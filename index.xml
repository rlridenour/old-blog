      <description>God of Love,
When I see a stranger,
do you see a beloved child?
When I see an enemy,
do you see a friend?
May I see what is,
and not what I fear might be.
Even more,
may I see what could be,
if I were to give even a fraction
of the grace that I have received.
Amen</description>

      <title>Abandoning Jubilee — The Structural Causes of Poverty</title>
      <link>http://randyridenour.net/project/jubilee-poverty/</link>

      <guid>http://randyridenour.net/project/jubilee-poverty/</guid>
      <description>The Jubilee law of Leviticus 25 is a radical economic plan which requires a leveling of real assets every fifty years, thus providing an economic structure that regularly dissolves large economic inequalities. It is impossible to follow the letter of the Jubilee law in a modern non-agrarian economy, but this should not free us from the responsibility of adhering to the spirit of the law. A survey of social structures in the United States reveals an economy that is contrary to the spirit of Jubilee, one that not only makes inequalities possible, but makes escaping from poverty nearly impossible.</description>

      <description>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s worship at NorthHaven Church was planned and led by Autumn Lockett, Josh Lockett, and Chris Canary. I was particularly struck by the words of one of the songs: &amp;ldquo;You make beautiful things out of the dust&amp;hellip; You make beautiful things out of us.&amp;rdquo;
Those words were exemplified later when the members of the congregation gathered to each put fingerprint leaves on Josh Lockett&amp;rsquo;s sketch of a tree, fingerprints from the young and the old, from those who have been in the community for years, and from those who have been there for only months.</description>

      <description>As a blog platform, Jekyll has a number of positive features:
 The speed and security of a static site, The convenience and future-proofing of plain text, and most importantly for educators, Free hosting on GitHub.  For me, the one drawback has been finding a convenient way to post using my iPad. There are a number of good Markdown editors for iOS, so writing posts is very easy, but publishing them can be a challenge.</description>

      <description>A prayer for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s sermon at Spring Creek Baptist Church:
God of life,
Sometimes our prayers are as parched as the desert
and our hearts as dry as the dunes of sand.
We take offense at things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter,
but ignore the ones that do.
When others are hungry,
we are full.
When others are hurting,
we are numb.
When others are cold,
we rest comfortably
beneath warm blankets of apathy.</description>

      <description>This is now my favorite 1-star book review on Amazon. It&amp;rsquo;s a review of R For Dummies, a book on the R statistics programing language:
 If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a book to explain the letter &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; to you, keep looking, this isn&amp;rsquo;t it.
 I hope that person eventually found what they needed.</description>

Dear students,
May God calm your anxieties,
refresh your minds,

Remember that God has gifted you
more than you can imagine,
and you are capable of more
than you&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed.
May the great wisdom of the Father,
the incomparable love of the Son,
and the mighty power of the Spirit</description>

      <description>Some thoughts on President Trump&amp;rsquo;s Executive Order on &amp;ldquo;Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty&amp;rdquo; that was recently issued:
First of all, the President&amp;rsquo;s executive order doesn&amp;rsquo;t change anything about religious leaders engaging in political action from the pulpit. This is from section 2, the relevant part of the order:
 The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury.</description>

      <description>What has given the South her identity are those beliefs and qualities which she has absorbed from the Scriptures and from her own history of defeat and violation: a distrust of the abstract, a sense of human dependence on the grace of God, and a knowledge that evil is not simply a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be endured. {:.big}

      <description>(Photograph: Weeping Mary by Martin Gommel)1 
&amp;ldquo;Who is it you are looking for?&amp;rdquo;
is a question for me,
not just for Mary.
Mary looked at Jesus, and saw the gardener.
I look at my
neighbor, and see a stranger;
a stranger, an see an antagonist;
an antagonist, and see an enemy.
Help me, Lord, to see you,
wherever, and whoever, you are.

      <description>(Mosaic: Carrying the Cross of Christ by Gabriel Loire)1
It is a sign
that we cannot
really understand
what it means
for God to die,
that we remember
this day when
truth and beauty
hung upon a cross
and we call it good.
What our minds cannot comprehend,
our words cannot express.
So, we can do nothing
but stand in silence
before the glory
and the horror
of the cross.</description>

      <description>This day of the church calendar, Maundy Thursday, gets its name from John 13:34, which, in the Latin Vulgate, begins with &amp;ldquo;mandatum novum&amp;rdquo; — a new commandment. After washing the feet of the disciples earlier in chapter 13, Jesus told them,
 I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.</description>

      <description>Holy God,
Examine my thoughts
on this Palm Sunday.
Does my Jesus&amp;hellip;
Want the very same things I want?
Love only the same people I love?
Hate all of the same people I hate?
Have an agenda that fits too easily into my own agenda?
Never say anything that makes me uncomfortable?
If so, then what is the object of my worship?
Is it a god of my own creation,</description>

Willing to betray the Lord,
and for what?
Not even thirty pieces of silver.
Lord, have mercy.

The sounds of Passover
fill the streets with
desperate bleating
as all the animals
must be dragged
to play their
sacrificial roles.
All, that is, save one
who goes quietly
with determination,
strength, and purpose.
Lamb of God
have mercy on me.

Lead me away from the
altar of my convenience,

what it means to love you.

      <description>In a recent discussion, one participate claimed that the &amp;ldquo;last eight years of Obamanomics has crippled our struggling state,&amp;rdquo; which I suspect is supported more by a political narrative than an analysis of the data.
The new administration is at least fortunate that the problems handed to them are not at the same level as those handed to the previous administration. During the Obama administration, economic growth was admittedly slow, but considering that he took office on the precipice of what could have been the second great depression, these national numbers look pretty good:</description>

      <description>Yesterday, the House of Representatives of the State of Oklahoma passed HB 1913, a bill giving lenders the ability to charge an Annual Percentage Rate of 205.92% on a $1,500 loan.1
This bill is inconsistent with historical Christian values and should be opposed by conservatives and progressives alike. The practice of taking interest on loans is expressly forbidden in several passages of Scripture:
 Exodus 22:25-27 Leviticus 25:35-38 Deuteronomy 23:19-20; 24:6 Psalm 15:5 Ezekiel 18:7-8; 22:12 Nehemiah 5:6-132  Before 1500, every Christian writer who discussed the practice expressly condemned the practice of charging interest.</description>

      <description>For I believe the crisis in the U.S. church has almost nothing to do with being liberal or conservative; it has everything to do with giving up on the faith and discipline of our Christian baptism and settling for a common, generic U.S. identity that is part patriotism, part consumerism, part violence, and part affluence. {:.big}

      <description>Holy God,
Shall this year be like the past,
giving up that which brings joy,
so that my self-imposed poverty may be
a sign of spiritual superiority?
Instead, Lord,
by your grace,
may I give up
bitterness, arrogance,
animosity, and the
unwarranted certainty
that keeps me from
loving my neighbor.
Cover me with your ashes,
and raise me again
to walk anew
in your kingdom.
Amen</description>

      <description>Thinking a lot about the power of language this week. Here&amp;rsquo;s my prayer for the week:
In arrogant blindness,
I fail to see that
what does not offend me
may still be offensive
to those around me.
Our words are keys,
with the power to
both lock and unlock.
They can open doors
to future conversations
or close them forever.
They can be vehicles of grace
or weapons of hate and destruction.</description>

      <description>Lord, hear my prayer.
For saying that something needs to be done
while refusing to do anything myself,
Lord, have mercy.
For believing that cries of outrage
were the same as acts of love,
Lord, have mercy.
For letting my own ego keep me from
reaching out to those with whom I disagree.
Lord, have mercy.
For pretending that loving humanity
was the same as loving my neighbor,

like the ones
who fight
with violence
and bloodshed.
Instead, we fight
with words and images,
tweets and memes,
dollars and budgets.
The weapons are different,
but the pain is just as real.
Lord,
If we are to fight,
may we fight for something
worth fighting for,
Not our ideologies,
nor our egos,
But for what is right,
and for those who have no voice.</description>

      <description>Gracious God,
We live in a time of change,
sometimes inspiring and exciting,
sometimes distressing and frightening,
but always challenging.
Yet even in the midst of upheaval,
we can be sure of this:
The Father still loves us,
the Son still calls us,
The Spirit still leads us,
and we must still follow –
Together,
one body,
one faith.

      <description>And perhaps the great day will come when a people, distinguished by wars and victories and by the highest development of a military order and intelligence, and accustomed to make the heaviest sacrifices for these things, will exclaim of its own free will, &amp;ldquo;We break the sword,&amp;rdquo; and will smash its entire military establishment down to its lowest foundations. Rendering oneself unarmed when one has been the best-armed, out of a height of feeling—that is the means to real peace, which must always rest on a peace of mind; whereas the so-called armed peace, as it now exists in all countries, is the absence of peace of mind.</description>

      <description>Holy God,
The greatest tragedy
is not to hate God,
for the one who hates
has God ever present
before his mind.
It is ambivalence,
thoughtless and uncaring,
a life that is at once
both full and empty,
full of trivialities,
yet empty of meaning
Heal my lukewarm heart, Lord,
and restore me to my first love.
Amen</description>

One person points down and says &amp;ldquo;Six.&amp;rdquo; The other points down, saying &amp;ldquo;Nine.&amp;rdquo; The original caption is &amp;ldquo;Just because you are right, does not mean I am wrong.&amp;rdquo; That caption is crossed out, and this rebuttal placed below:
 But one of those people is wrong, someone painted a six or nine, they need to back up ad orient themselves, see if there are any other numbers to alight with.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m usually in favor of building walls, but not when it just becomes another way to burn bridges.
Prayer Almighty God,
I give thanks for those who are here today to help build this house, for those who have already worked to bring us to this point, and for those who will be here in the future.</description>

Am I Mary, saying yes when others would jeer?

When a new emperor took the throne in Rome, messengers were sent to the rich and powerful to deliver &amp;ldquo;glad tidings&amp;rdquo; of Caesar, who was called &amp;ldquo;savior and lord&amp;rdquo; and promised to bring peace to the empire through the power of his vast riches and his mighty armies.
But when the King was born in Bethlehem, messengers from God were sent, not to the rich and powerful, but to those too poor to be noticed by the empire.</description>

      <description>Father of Light,
The creator of the universe
came to us as a helpless child,
reminding us that there is no
reconciliation without risk
or love without a chance of loss.
But we sacrificed peace
on the altar of security,
preferring to remain in darkness
than to venture out into the light,
desiring our kingdom more than yours.
Give us the courage
to drop our guard,
and open our lives</description>

      <description>The Gospel text for the third Sunday of Advent in year A is Matthew 11:2-11, which, on the surface, seems like an odd choice for the Christmas season, especially for a day known as the &amp;ldquo;Sunday of joy.&amp;rdquo; It opens with what is apparently some doubt on the part of John the Baptist: &amp;ldquo;When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, &amp;lsquo;Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?</description>

      <description>Love left its throne,
to join us in our
weakness and frailty,
divine majesty
in a helpless babe,
To walk,
and laugh,
and cry
with us,
To show us what love
was willing to risk
for our sake.
And no matter
how much we tried,
even we could not
destroy its power.
Today, may love again
walk with my feet and
speak through my mouth.

 Well, this isn&amp;rsquo;t just a Trump-supporter problem. This is a right-wing issue. Sarah Palin&amp;rsquo;s famous blasting of the lamestream media is kind of record and testament to the rise of these kinds of people. The post-fact era is what I would refer to it as.</description>

Daily, we are faced with a choice
to be people who live in cynicism and despair,
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.
On this day, we choose gratitude over despair,

What are these hands?

      <description>There are circumstances during which my failure becomes clearly evident, and the events of the past few days have given me needed opportunity to reflect on that failure.
God&amp;rsquo;s commandment is to love — a commandment given not to an abstract entity such as government or the church, but a commandment given to me.
Even more, God commanded me to love my neighbor — not the world or humanity, but my neighbor, the one who weeps in fear and pain, the one who offends me, the one with whom I disagree, and the one of whom I take no notice.</description>

      <description>There are three statements that have become known as the &amp;ldquo;Chinese&amp;rdquo; curses, although I should point out that there is no record of any Chinese equivalents. They are three things to wish upon one&amp;rsquo;s enemies. Three things that, on the surface, seem like things that a person should surely want; but appearances, as we all know, are often deceiving.
The first, and the mildest:

      <description>Prayer for All Saints Day
Lord,
We search for heroes
among the rich, powerful,
strong and proud —
those who look more
like the crucifiers
than the crucified.
But on this day,
we give thanks
for those for whom
loving is more important
than being loved,
and faithfulness more
dear than fame.
Not our idols,
instead, your saints.
Amen</description>

      <description>A prayer for the days preceding the election:
God of comfort,
No matter the result,
Half of us will find
That the thing we fear
Will have come true.
Calm our fears,
And restore our faith.
Cleanse our despair,
And give us hope.
Banish our anger,
And renew our love.
Remind us once again
That the Spirit who unites us
Is greater than anything
That could ever divide us.
Amen</description>

      <description>God of Grace,
When Jesus was offered
the choice to be used
or to be silent,
He chose silence.
May I guard against
the temptation to craft
an image of Jesus to use
for my own political

Thy will, not my own, Lord.

      <title>Confirmation Bias and the Clinton Foundation</title>

      <description>Yesterday, I showed that claiming that only 5.7% of Clinton Foundation donations goes to charity is essentially false. Although that is indeed the percentage that goes to other charitable organizations, it ignores the fact that the Clinton Foundation is itself a public charity, unlike the Trump Foundation, which is a private foundation.
In response, a friend said that, although my claim was technically true, the majority of Clinton Foundation money goes back to the Clintons through the its two largest program expenditures, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) and the Clinton Presidential Library.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that political fact-checking is largely useless. Either people completely ignore the work of fact-checkers, or the fact-checkers ignore the relevant facts. Today, I saw a claim that Clinton had leaked classified information about the nuclear response window. What was curious was that the post included a link to a snopes.com story explaining that the supposed leak was not classified, but was already public information. The person evidently failed to read the very story to which they had linked.</description>

If such a slender trunk

our branches reach out
to shelter those in need,
then reach up to the heavens
to bid your Kingdom come,

      <description>I just read a Facebook comment by someone who was apparently downplaying the Black Lives Matter movement by pointing out that the police shoot more white Americans than black Americans.
True, but it&amp;rsquo;s a classic error in statistical reasoning. The vast majority of drivers involved in accidents are sober, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow that one is more likely to have an accident if one is sober than if drunk. That is, the probability that a person was drunk given that he was in an accident is very low, but the probability that someone will be in an accident given that he is drunk is very high.</description>

      <description>Creator God,
I gaze out from my fortress,
and see a dangerous, hostile place,
with dangers on all sides,
forcing me to defend my territory
against my many enemies.
Sometimes, I see a cold, unfeeling place,
that demands that I care only for myself,
since no one else will care for me.
Tell me what I would see, Lord,
if only I could replace these
grimy panes of doubt and fear,</description>

      <description>What is the reason for separating Plato&amp;rsquo;s dialogues into Socratic (early) and Platonic (middle) dialogues? Why is Socrates’ method primarily negative? Is there anything that Socrates does (at least implicitly) claim to know? Explain why the Meno is considered a transitional dialogue. Explain Meno&amp;rsquo;s Paradox. How does Plato respond? Although Socrates claims ignorance, he seems to hold some surprising philosophical positions. Explain. Why did Socrates not plead for his life?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the USO at the Portland airport with some time to write the prayer for the week. The week of 9&amp;frasl;11 is always a time of reflection for me. In past years, I&amp;rsquo;ve generally thought about the cost to military families, compared to a country that mostly feels inconvenienced at the airport. This year, I thought instead about the wonderful friends I made during two deployments. Although I do wish that the conflict had never happened, those friends are gifts from God that I will always cherish.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t be distracted by the concerns of the world,
but stay focused on the hope that is within you.

      <description>Thank you for the gift of friends,
those who are near,
and those who are far;
those still with us,
and those who await us
in the life to come.
Kind words remind us
that there is no distance,
neither time, nor space,
neither this life, nor the next,
that cannot be crossed.
For nothing can separate us
from the love of God,
and by that same love,
we are connected to each other.</description>

not by whom I exclude,
but by whom I include;
not by my enemies,
but by my friends;
for an enemy truly loved
is but a friend to be.

In our questions,
may the grace of God
be enough, until that day
that we know fully,
even as we are fully known.
Now, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,

      <description>I should have rather asked if the church alone should bear the burden of providing welfare. There is no doubt that the church, myself included, should bear more of the burden of caring for the poor, for that is just one of the many sacrificial things Jesus calls us to do. The church, though, cannot bear the welfare burden as it is today. Ron Sider, in Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America, estimates that shouldering just the cost of Medicaid would cost each Christian congregation approximately one-half million dollars per year.</description>

we have mourned with those who grieve,
cried with those who weep,
sat in silence with those in pain,
and protested with those who suffer injustice.

seems to happen over and over again,
until we are left with nothing
but bloodshot eyes and numb hearts.

Vim is speedy, and since I use Evil on Emacs, it&amp;rsquo;s not too painful to switch occasionally.

God of peace,
We pray for those who
bear the scars of war,

when the war is within one&amp;rsquo;s own soul.
Give them the courage to speak,

      <description>Lord Jesus,
On this day that we mourn
the loss of so many whom you love,
it is tempting to pray
that you would return
and take us from this world.
Tempting, because it shifts
the burden to you,
leaving nothing for us
but escape, evasion, and excuse.
Yet you are not the God who excuses,
but the God who redeems;
not the God of escape,
but the God of the cross.</description>

      <description>I have been browsing Jekyll themes lately, and found a very nice theme for academics, the Ed. Theme. Its main purpose seems to be publishing classic texts and poetry on the web, and it includes some very handy tools.
Getting indentation right is a problem with poetry on the web. For example, consider these lines from &amp;ldquo;The Code—Heroics&amp;rdquo; by Robert Frost.
Here is the Markdown source:

      <description>Here is my attempt at pull quotes in the Lanyon/Poole theme for Jekyll:
.pquote { float: right; width: 15rem; color: #979797; font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8rem; font-style: italic; padding: 1rem; quotes: &amp;quot;\201C&amp;quot;&amp;quot;\201D&amp;quot;&amp;quot;\2018&amp;quot;&amp;quot;\2019&amp;quot;; }  I just learned that Kramdown makes it easy to specify classes and attributes. So, this produces the pull quote:
&amp;gt; This is some quoted text. {:.pquote}  The final result looks like this:1
 &amp;ldquo;Pull quotes are easy to code and add a nice touch to the site.</description>

      <description>I passed a church this morning that had this statement on the sign: &amp;ldquo;Indifference Not Hate.&amp;rdquo; I’m curious what is meant by this, is it supposed to be a statement of reassurance to the community? &amp;ldquo;It’s not that we hate you, we really just don’t care.&amp;rdquo; Would you rather be hated or simply ignored? At least hate is an acknowledgment of the existence and importance of the other person.</description>

 In April, Martin Luther King was arrested and jailed in Birmingham. In May, “Bull” Connor, the Commissioner of Public Safety in Birmingham used police dogs and fire hoses on a demonstration in Birmingham. In June, Medgar Evers, the NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi, was murdered outside his home.</description>

for surely you have seen it;
of the stranger,
for she was made in your image,

so that we may speak
with one voice of the
unending love of God.

We live in a world
with walls both
visible and invisible;
some protect us from harm,
and others protect
us from inconvenience,
hearing only the voices

Open a window in the walls,
so that we may hear the voice
of the one who needs to be heard,
who speaks in a still, small voice
so often drowned out by our noisy lives.

We live in fear

disappointment,
afraid that we

the wrong thing.
Paralyzed by risk,
we simply do nothing
and remain silent.
But who am I,
blind as I am,
to judge what does
or does not fail?
Help me to trust in you,

work together for good,
for, to, and through
those who love you.</description>

that the Spirit still calls,

Today, it is one who,

calls us to recover

of our first calling.
As her faith grows,
so may ours also.
We can only dream of what
you have in store for her,

to at least not get in the way.</description>

You said, &amp;ldquo;When told

When Thomas was told
that you appeared
in the inner rooms,
he heeded your word

Holy Saturday,
the day of waiting,
after all of our
hopes and dreams
have been crushed
by a cruel world
and a naive idealism
is forced to succumb
to a harsher reality.
But even after the
horrors of Friday,
the morning sun still
rose on Saturday.
And we have hope,
however faint,
however absurd.
So we wait,
wait to see
what Sunday
will bring.

To demand my rights,

Not my will, but yours be done.

It is an easy path

As I though about the passage, I was struck by Simon&amp;rsquo;s willingness to pay for the power to confer the Holy Spirit on others, that is, his desire to exchange financial power for religious power. That, in turn, prompted me to think about the current role of religion in politics.

We take offense at things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter,

When others are hungry,
we are full.
When others are hurting,
we are numb.
When others are cold,
we rest comfortably
beneath warm blankets of apathy.

we still feel something,</description>

never truly live.

      <description>Holy God,
You call us into the night,
into the darkness,
to a place without distraction
where we can see only ourselves,
not as we wish we were,
but as we truly are.
We come hesitantly,
for we are afraid
to acknowledge
what we have become.
We come trembling,
knowing that hearts
that are hard
must somehow be broken.
We come with hope,
knowing that what
is broken can
again be made whole</description>

      <description>God of compassion,
Peter and John met a man
asking for alms
at the Beautiful Gate
of the temple.
We are not like Peter and John,
when they met the man
at the Beautiful Gate,
for we do have
silver and gold
to give.
But before we give,
we pray that you
would examine our hearts.
Do we give to maintain
the myth of our own superiority?
Do we give as a a means of exercising power?</description>

      <description>We left Accra, Ghana at 2300 last Saturday night. After thirty hours of traveling, we arrived in Oklahoma City. Monday night, I had to go visit my father at his hospital. Tuesday and Wednesday, I taught a Bible study on forgiveness at First Baptist Church, Sparks, OK. Thursday night, I had my three hour political philosophy class. Finally, on Friday, I came down with a stomach bug, for which I should be thankful — I went to bed and slept for eighteen hours.</description>

Lord,
If I really need it,
help me to remember to pack it.
If I really don&amp;rsquo;t need it,
help me to resist the temptation to take it.
And if I need it and forget it,
may it be something I would have lost over there anyway.</description>

When a new emperor
took the throne,
messengers were sent
to the rich and powerful
to deliver &amp;ldquo;glad tidings&amp;rdquo;
of Caesar, who was called
&amp;ldquo;savior and lord&amp;rdquo; and
promised to bring
peace to the empire
through the power
of his vast riches
and his mighty armies.

      <description>God of joy,
A cacophony of voices
demand our daily attention,
some calling us to
the bitter resignation
of despair, others, to the
sweet, but empty, vanity
of self-righteousness.
Joy, though, speaks with
a quiet and unassuming voice,
much like a babe born
to poor parents and
laid in a manger to sleep.
Cleanse my heart

blocks the empty noise
of the season,

      <description>God of Peace,
There was a time when
we built idols of stone
that separated us from you.
Now, we are tempted
to build new idols,
walls that separate us
from those created
in your own image.
Forgive us, Lord,
for loving our own safety
more than we love the gospel,
and for sacrificing
the dream of true peace
on the altar of a
false sense of security.

      <description>Father,
I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by voices
telling me what I want to hear,
voices urging me to seek my own good,
to protect what is mine,
that my security is more important
than the needs of others.
Help me, Lord,
to hear a different message,
one that challenges me
to become something
better than I have been,
and to dismantle my own petty kingdom
for the sake of the Kingdom of God.</description>

Almighty God,
We grieve this week,
crying with those who suffer,
lamenting with those who mourn.
Even in our anger,
May we always seek justice,
and never revenge;
healing, not harm;
and a measured response,
instead of thoughtless reaction.
When circumstances tempt us
to sink into the depths of despair,
may we hear the prophet&amp;rsquo;s voice,</description>

Merciful God,
At least three while

Eighty today,
as we rest
on the Sabbath,
Thirty thousand lives
lost in a single year.
Some were taken
by their own hand,
some by accident,
still others by strangers.
All were lost in
brutal acts of violence,
sacrificed on the altar
of our rights.

one that is perfect
for people like us.
But what do we hope to find?
A church filled
with perfect people?
People who have no faults,
who speak no unkind words,
who never hurt one another,
and never have regrets?
A perfect church, indeed,
but a church with no place</description>

      <description>Gracious God, Giver of life,
Long ago,
a tree was planted by your grace
and watered by your providential care.
It was robbed of
life and beauty,
and used to fashion a cross
to bear body of the Christ,
broken for our redemption.
And so, Lord, like that tree,
we have been planted,
watered, and have grown,
yet the time has come for us
to offer our lives to you,</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Where are you?&amp;rdquo;
The sound of heartbreak
rang through the garden
as the Lord went out
in the cool of the evening
to meet his children,
who hid in the place
that he gave them,
a place made for
fellowship with God.
God still calls,
and we still hide,
in places built for
communion with him,
masking our shame and fear
by doing the good while
failing to hear his call</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t find the original source of this blessing, but it&amp;rsquo;s attributed to the Franciscans. It&amp;rsquo;s both powerful and provocative to think of discomfort, anger, tears, and foolishness as blessings.
 May God bless you with discomfort,
At easy answers, half-truths,
And superficial relationships
So that you may live
Deep within your heart.
May God bless you with anger
At injustice, oppression,
And exploitation of people,
So that you may work for</description>

Lord, teach me to hold my tongue.
Our minds are filled

Lord, teach me instead to listen.
Our eyes search

furnished by others
who were models,
teachers, and guides.
And as our paths diverge,
we take joy in this:
those who came before
are woven into the very
fabric of our lives,
each single thread
a gift of your divine grace.

      <description>Glennon Doyle Melton at momastery.com posted an article with the provocative title, &amp;ldquo;If You Wouldn’t Go to Your Minister for a Mammogram, Don’t Go for Depression.&amp;rdquo; In it, she makes the important point that there are those in Christian communities that advocate treatment of depression through prayer alone, refusing to see it as a medical condition, yet those same people would not treat cancer simply with prayer. In this, I wholeheartedly agree.</description>

that lays aside useless cares
and finds new hope in you.

A couple of weeks later, I finally convinced my wife to start using a password manager, and having already purchased 1Password from the App Store, I decided to take advantage of family sharing.</description>

      <description>Lord Jesus,
My mind is filled with
beautiful memories
and wonderful dreams,
thoughts of things that were
and others that may someday be.
But one eye to the past,
and the other to the future,
leaves me blind to this moment;
thanking you for life,
while refusing to live it.
May I never forget
that the Lord of the past and future
is also Lord in the meantime.

Suscipe (Receive)
Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty,
my memory, my understanding
and my entire will,
All I have and call my own.
You have given all to me.
To you, Lord, I return it.
Everything is yours; do with it what you will.
Give me only your love and your grace.
That is enough for me.</description>

tragedy,
injustice,

And even we,
watching from places
of comfort and security
can be overwhelmed
by the darkness,
and begin to lose hope.
Then, we see a baby smile,
and the light breaks in,
reminding us that hope prevails
and that beauty surrounds us,
a gracious reminder of

Despite my presumptuous plans,
there is no guarantee of the future,
not even of the next moment on this earth;
for that moment is hidden from me until it comes,
and only you know what this day will bring.
Help me to see this day for what it is,
a gift, although expected,
one that was surely not owed,
an act of immeasurable grace.
So, thank you for this day</description>

 This is where a tremendous decision takes place: whether we Christians have enough strength to witness before the world that we are not dreamers with our heads in the clouds&amp;hellip; that our faith really is not opium that keeps us content within an unjust world. Instead, and precisely because our minds are set on things above, we are that much more stubborn and purposeful in protesting here on earth&amp;hellip; Does it have to be that Christianity, which began as immensely revolutionary, now has to remain conservative for all time?</description>

Add this to your shell rc file (in my case, .zshrc):
# open a dired window for the current directory dired() { emacsclient -e &amp;quot;(dired \&amp;quot;$PWD\&amp;quot;)&amp;quot; }  Then, assuming that Emacs server is running, type &amp;ldquo;dired&amp;rdquo; in the shell, and a Dired buffer of that directory opens in the current Emacs frame.</description>

Father,
Protect us from the arrogance
of unwarranted certainty,
as it keeps us from hearing
the voice of our neighbor.
Cleanse us from the vanity
of inflated self-importance,
as it moves us to see only ourselves.</description>

 If selling a gay couple a wedding cake means a &amp;ldquo;christian&amp;rdquo; baker participated in their marriage, does selling a gun to a murderer mean a &amp;ldquo;christian&amp;rdquo; gun store owner participated in the murder?
 The gun store owner does indeed participate in the murder, though not in a way that makes him1 morally responsible for the murder.</description>

when, against all odds,
love won.
Our joy, though, is not yet complete,

      <description>A reflection on the lives lost this week in Charleston, and the responsibility that we bear, either explicitly or implicitly:
God of justice,
We are told that heaven rejoices
over what has been found,
does heaven also weep for
what has been lost?
For the one whose heart
was lost in hatred,
and whose mind was
filled with empty lies?
For the nine lives that
were taken in an act</description>

      <description>A poem by James Weldon Johnson (June 17, 1871 – June 26, 1938), American author, educator, lawyer, diplomat, and civil rights activist.
Nine people were shot in a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina, this week, and the evidence points to it being a racist hate-crime. So, 144 years and 1 day after his birth, we are reminded that some things, unfortunately have not changed.

How would you have us, as we are?</description>

I took a hint from this script and fixed the problem today. Search for the applescript &amp;ldquo;open_in_chrome.scpt&amp;rdquo;, then change the line</description>

      <description>Great God of beauty and wonder,
There are days when I wish
that you had given us
a blueprint for life,
with every step
mapped out in detail,
and every decision
already made.
Instead, you gave us
each a life for a canvas,
and gifts and talents
for a palette and brushes,
the Spirit for our guide,
and the Son for our model,
then you sent us out
into the world to paint.</description>

      <description>Gracious God,
who knows us better
than we know ourselves,
Forgive me,
when I quickly judge
a harsh word,
or impolite response
without knowing
the full story.
Everyone has a story,
and every encounter
affects the plot,
and each moment
is another opportunity
to transform the tale
from hopeless tragedy
to divine beauty.

      <description>This is one of those posts that serve only to remind me of something in the future. My Emacs configuration was working well on one machine. Whenever I opened dired on another machine, though, this error was returned:
wrong type argument: stringp, nil
Finally, I remembered that I had required GNU ls in my Emacs settings, and had not installed it on the machine in question. A quick &amp;ldquo;brew install coreutils&amp;rdquo; to install the GNU Command Line Tools with Homebrew did the trick.</description>

      <description>As I said a few days ago, I switch my Emacs config files to Kieran Healy&amp;rsquo;s Starter Kit. I really liked the use of Org-mode for the config, and especially the LaTeX and RefTeX configuration. I still like Batsov&amp;rsquo;s Prelude, though, and there were certainly some things that I missed greatly.
This afternoon, I found Mike McFarland&amp;rsquo;s Emacs configuration online. He uses Prelude with a personal configuration in Org-mode. I have switched back, and brought in much of Kieran&amp;rsquo;s LaTeX configuration.</description>

      <description>Triune God,
In those times
that we feel alone,
lost in the crowd,
and disconnected
from those around us,
we take comfort in knowing
that at the center of reality
is an unending community of love,
and that we, your children,
have been invited into
the eternal fellowship
that is the
Father,
Son,
and Holy Spirit,
three persons,
but one God,
forever and ever.

      <description>The first week of a break from classes is always a good time for a massive reconfiguration of something tech-related. Last time it was the blog, this time it is Emacs. Since I primarily use Emacs only for LaTeX and Markdown editing, I though I would give Kieran Healy&amp;rsquo;s Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences a try. He has done a masterful job of setting up a great LaTeX editing machine.</description>

in such a way that they

to something worth
sacrificing for,
something greater than
even their own lives.

      <description>I was excited to see this excerpt from Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s new book recently in USA Today, explaining why he chose &amp;ldquo;Trigger Warning&amp;rdquo; as the title. It didn&amp;rsquo;t strike me that the title could be controversial until I saw this tweet asking why he chose such a &amp;ldquo;thoughtless and insensitive title.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that such accusations prompted a rather thoughtful and sensitive response from Gaiman, one of my favorite authors.</description>

      <description>A poem for Memorial Day, 2015, written after conducting a funeral at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery, April 23, 2015.
The boy stared, amazed
at the ranks and files
of perfect straight lines.
Each member stood
at attention, a silent and still
granite memorial to one
who was a child once
before youth was taken,
leaving only scars
if anything at all.</description>

      <description>God of Grace and Wholeness,
All around us, we see pain and heartache,
the effects of fragmented and broken systems,
communities, and families.
When the pain of others becomes
too much for us to bear,
we respond by building up walls
that separate us from the world.
So here we stay,
safe and secure
behind our walls of division,
seeing only ourselves,
our own problems,
and our own hopes.
We boast of our love for humanity,</description>

      <description>Thanks to AJ Lopez for sharing this quote with me.
Instead of telling our vulnerable stories, we seek safety in abstractions, speaking to each other about our opinions, ideas and beliefs rather than about our lives. Academic culture blesses this practice by insisting that the more abstract our speech, the more likely we are to touch the universal truths that unite us. But what happens is exactly the reverse: as our discourse becomes more abstract, the less connected we feel.</description>

      <description>Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day can be an awkward time in the life of the church. There is a great deal of internal pressure to commemorate the day, but we should acknowledge that there are many who are understandably uncomfortable on this day. There are those who may have painful memories of abuse at the hand of their biological mothers, others who may have never known their mothers, and many others who have never had, nor will ever have, children of their own.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s prayer is simple, but informed by events of the week that profoundly impacted me. First, NorthHaven Church​ was in the area that sustained some wind damage in Wednesday night&amp;rsquo;s storm. The next day, Imam Imad Enchassi​ of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City graciously asked if we needed any help. To all our Muslim friends, As-Salaam-Alaikum.
Second, I see in my students a level of spiritual depth that I certainly did not have in my 20&amp;rsquo;s and may not yet have in my 50&amp;rsquo;s — one that moves beyond the superficial trivialities that pass for spirituality in much of American religion, but instead shows a deep understanding of the message of Jesus.</description>

      <description>A cry for justice swells up
from a people who have seen
so little of it.
&amp;ldquo;Yes, justice,&amp;rdquo;
comes the reply,
&amp;ldquo;But first,
we must have peace.
Peace today,
maybe justice tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;
But a peace without justice,
is not the Shalom of God.
It is a peace that serves
the status quo,
the interests of the powerful,
and the coffers of the wealthy.
The prophets tell us that
your justice is measured</description>

      <description>Holy God,
There are times when
we just have no words,
times of great beauty,
or times of great suffering.
But our silence
makes us uncomfortable,
and we feel that
we must say something,
so we fill the silence
with meaningless noise
and empty chatter.
So, when we feel the urge
to trivialize the sublime
with our vain babbling,
give us the strength
to cover our mouths
and stand before</description>

      <description>This past weekend was a weekend of funerals — two very different people, both with lives that had been cut tragically short. Then, on Tuesday, I learned of two more tragedies involving families in the Army units that I serve. Coincidentally, all of this happens as one of my classes is studying one of the central works on the problem of suffering, the chapter titled in &amp;ldquo;Rebellion&amp;rdquo; in Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece, The Brothers Karamazov.</description>

      <description>Believing in the resurrection does not just mean assenting to a dogma and noting a historical fact. It means participating in this creative act of God. Resurrection is not a consoling opium, soothing us with the promise of a better world in the hereafter. It is the energy for a rebirth of this life. The hope doesn’t point to another world. It is focused on the redemption of this one. Jürgen Moltmann</description>

      <description>Tiny gold crosses
hang from sparkling
gold chains,
signs of
wealth, affluence,
and good taste,
compared to
a large wooden cross
covered in blood,
an instrument of torture,
a symbol designed
to bring terror
to enemies of the state.
On this day, Lord,
give me a vision
of the horror of the cross,
for without it
there is no beauty
of the cross.
Amen</description>

      <description>Lord,
How would you have us known to the world?
By whom we exclude?
By what we hate?
By whom we refuse to serve?
By our purity?
Instead, we are to be known
by our love&amp;hellip;
Love,
in all its
messy,
entangled,
accepting,
and sometimes awkward
beauty.
Amen</description>

      <description>With praise and palm branches,
the people celebrated
their new freedom
from their Greek overlords.
And in a new century,
and under a new empire,
the people once again
wave the palm branches
and cheer for a new hero.
Jesus rode into Jerusalem
and the people cheered,
but Jesus wept,
for they could not see
that the Jesus for whom we cheer
is not the same Jesus
that we behold upon the cross</description>

      <description>It is telling that the cry from the cross, &amp;ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&amp;rdquo; is followed by the simple declaration, &amp;ldquo;I thirst.&amp;rdquo; We thirst for God, not because God has forsaken us, nor because we have forsaken God. We simply thirst for God — we thirst for God&amp;rsquo;s mercy, we thirst for God&amp;rsquo;s justice in this world, we thirst to be loved by God&amp;rsquo;s people as God loves us.</description>

      <description>So far, this has been the most challenging and difficult chapter for me. Hauerwas challenges us reflect on our standard interpretations of Jesus&amp;rsquo; cry of despair from the cross, &amp;ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&amp;rdquo; and understand it not in terms of one who is sacrificed to satisfy a vengeful God, but as a cry from the God who both sacrifices and is sacrificed. That we find this cry of Jesus so difficult to comprehend shows that we, as citizens of this world, understand and identify with the power and authority of the empire.</description>

to heal her daughter,
and Jesus said nothing.
Pilate asked Jesus
to defend himself,
and Jesus said nothing.
Yet the girl was healed,
and Jesus went to the cross.
Forgive me, Lord,

saying everything but
doing nothing.

      <description>Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s Fear and Trembling focuses on Abraham, an example of what Kierkegaard calls a &amp;ldquo;Knight of Faith.&amp;rdquo; When I asked for other examples, someone suggested Mary, the mother of Jesus. At the time, I was skeptical, because it did not seem to me that Mary had an opportunity to reject God&amp;rsquo;s plan; the angel Mary announced that Mary would conceive, and never asked Mary if she wanted to cooperate in this endeavor.</description>

      <description>A prayer for reconciliation.
God of love,
We open our arms
to hug and to hold,
welcome and invite.
With outstretched hands,
we lower our defenses
and accept the vulnerability
that comes with love.
Did the soldiers know
what they were doing
as they stretched the arms
of Jesus onto the cross?
Humiliated and scorned,
the Eternal King
chose vulnerability, love,
and reconciliation
instead of rejection.
Give us the courage</description>

      <description>I struggled with the second chapter of Hauerwas&amp;rsquo; book, The Cross-Shattered Christ1, not because the chapter was particularly hard to follow, but because it forced me to reflect on my life as a teacher and minister. The chapter opened with a discussion of the reticence of the Gospels, why do they not tell us everything that we want to know? Why is Jesus simply silent on what many of us think are the most important questions of the day?</description>

And I say,

I see a woman
alone, in tears,
mourning,
And I say,
&amp;ldquo;Thank you, Lord,

I see a man
upon a cross,
humiliated, scorned,
despised,
And suddenly my
foolish pride is clear
even to me,
And I cry,

      <description>Lord Jesus,
As I find myself
grasping for more,
even though I
surely have enough,
I hear the voice
of the Spirit whisper,
&amp;ldquo;Is this how you
follow the one
who had no place
to lay his head,
whose only robe
was taken from him
and gambled away?&amp;rdquo;
May I never confuse
the abundant life
with an empty
life of abundance.

      <description>Reflections on Cross-Shattered Christ: Meditations on the Seven Last Words by Stanley Hauerwas, Chapter 1.
This chapter is perfect reading for the week following Ash Wednesday. The traditional liturgical declaration uttered by the minister &amp;ldquo;Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return&amp;rdquo; is a reminder of our mortality. Ash Wednesday is quickly forgotten, though, just as the somber reflection that occurs after a funeral quickly fades as life returns to normal.</description>

      <description>Father,
In the blindness of our arrogance,
we think that we are free,
yet, so often, we are in chains,
slaves to the satisfaction of our own desires,
and to the pursuit of our own selfish ends.
Our prayer today is that
we may be transformed,
freed, so that we may
live as Christ lived,
and love as he loved,
every moment of our lives
an act of restoration and redemption,</description>

You found a man living in a cemetery,
bound by chains that he did not forge,
forced on him by people who were afraid.
I, too, am bound in chains,
some forged by ignorance,
every link a failure to recognize
your image in another human.
Others forged by arrogance,
of thinking that there are those
not fit for your kingdom,
or for your service.
Still others forged by fear,</description>

      <description>Cultural Relativism For many of those that hold the position, cultural relativism is motivated by a belief that we should be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Most of the time, this is expressed in a way that is simply inconsistent, that is, given that there are no objective, universal moral truths, we ought to be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Unfortunately, one cannot consistently assert both that there are no objective, universal, moral truths and that we have a moral obligation to be tolerant, especially since our culture is often intolerant.</description>

      <description>The Bible is very easy to understand. But we as Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand we are obliged to act accordingly. My God, you will say, if I do that my whole life will be ruined.

      <description>This was a prayer I delivered at NorthHaven Church in Norman for the Christmas Day service on December 25, 2011.
Gracious Father,
We gather here in this place to celebrate the day the world changed.
On that day, one who was pure spirit became incarnate;
The eternal Word became clothed in a frail human body;
That which no human had ever touched was laid by a gentle mother&amp;rsquo;s hand into a simple manger;</description>

      <description>Out of love for mankind, and out of despair at my embarrassing situation, seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, and moved by a genuine interest in those who are dedicated to making everything easy, I conceived it as my task [the task of the philosopher] to create difficulties everywhere.

      <description>The parable of the Good Samaritan is prompted by a lawyer&amp;rsquo;s question in Luke 10:29, &amp;ldquo;But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, &amp;lsquo;And who is my neighbor?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; That phrase, &amp;ldquo;But wanting to justify himself&amp;rdquo; plays an important role in a sermon of mine, where I claimed that this places the lawyer on par with the typical caller on a talk-radio show. On this reading, the phrase means something like, &amp;ldquo;In order to impress those listening in,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;In order to sound smarter than he really was.</description>

      <description>Mitch Randall&amp;rsquo;s sermon this Sunday was on loving one&amp;rsquo;s enemies, a notion that I believe is the radically distinctive concept in the ethics of Jesus. This week&amp;rsquo;s prayer:
In this deeply divided world,
the best we hope for is
tolerance,
absence of conflict,
live and let live.
The path that we have taken
is not the way of Jesus,
who said,
&amp;ldquo;Love your enemies and
pray for those who persecute you.</description>

      <description>John Gruber recently posted this interesting quote from Penn Jillette, of Penn and Teller fame:
 There is no god and that’s the simple truth. If every trace of any single religion died out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created exactly that way again. There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense. If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.</description>

      <description>As I wrote recently, everything in existence is permanently impermanent. Patrick Rhone
 I detect shades of Heraclitus here.
Question: is this a paradox? Answer: probably not, unless Rhone is committed to the belief that nothing at all, even impermanence, is permanent. It is a good opportunity to do some analytic philosophy, though.
What is permanence? Is it a real property, or is it a derivative analyzed in terms of the real properties of an object?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m testing blogging to the new Jekyll blog from Emacs using the Lisp code from William Denton. It works extremely well. I had to remap the key definitions since C-c j was already used for something else in my configuration. It&amp;rsquo;s bad Emacs form, but I used C-x j instead. So, C-x j n asks for a post title, then creates a file in the drafts folder with the front matter already inserted.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s not very difficult in ordinary circumstances, but since I bought from the App Store, it should have been even easier. There should be no need to enter any license information, just a click and install.
First, I deleted the app. I deleted BBEdit from the applications folder. Somehow, it was still in Launchpad.</description>

It turns out that typing &amp;ldquo;. ~/.zshrc&amp;rdquo; will do it. The problem is that I&amp;rsquo;m not likely to remember it. I found this nice tip at codeM0nK3Y.</description>

So, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to return a small amount by paying for Marked, his great tool for previewing Markdown files.

I have been calling Marked from Emacs using this function that I found in various places on the internet:</description>

There is no doubt that regular expressions are very powerful. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the documentation for regular expressions is often as mysterious as the things that the documentation is supposed to explain.</description>

      <description>Lord Jesus,
What kind of king are you?
The kingdoms of this earth
Pride themselves on their power,
Their majesty,
Their influence,
And their wealth.
Yet you say that your kingdom is like
A small seed,
Yeast,
And a net.
May your kingdom fill our lives
As the yeast permeates the dough.
As we grow from this small seed
May we provide shelter and shade to those in need,
Yet remaining rooted in you,</description>

      <description>What is it like
to burn,
but never burn up;
to endure the pain
of the flame,
but never know
the relief of destruction?
With no hope for the future,
and no memory of their past,
your people endured
the burden of slavery;
people who burn,
but never burn up.
Then Moses heard a voice,

      <description>The one who had already
shed all the privileges of God,
also shed his outer robe.
Wrapping himself in a simple towel,
he lovingly washed the disciples&amp;rsquo; feet
with his calloused hands.
Teach us, Lord, to shed
our own trappings of power and prestige,
as we reach out to those rejected by the world;
and may we always have the grace to accept
the things that you have had the grace to offer.</description>

      <description>Even though I fear the answer,
I must still ask the question
that was posed
by the one who betrayed the Lord.
&amp;ldquo;Am I the one?&amp;rdquo;
Am I the one who
sat in the comfort
of the palace of the High Priest
to plot your death
because you were a threat
to my religious authority?
Am I the one who
from the confines of another palace
washed my hands of you,</description>

Turn the other cheek,
Sell all you have,
Give to the poor,
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry,
Forgive,
Be not afraid.&amp;rdquo;
We reply,
&amp;ldquo;Surely, he didn&amp;rsquo;t mean what he said.
We can&amp;rsquo;t,
It&amp;rsquo;s not natural,
It&amp;rsquo;s impossible.&amp;rdquo;
Then Easter comes,
And we are left speechless.
May your beauty draw us,
Your power strengthen us,
And your love compel us
To live fully as citizens of your kingdom.</description>

      <description>For the NorthHaven Church Deacon Ordination Service
April 27, 2014
I have been asked to deliver a charge to the congregation on this occasion. A reasonable question to ask is why should the church be tasked with anything in the event of a deacon ordination? It is the new deacons that have been tasked to do something; the church is simply the recipient of those actions, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? So, what is the point of a charge to the church?</description>

      <description>A prayer prompted by the deacon ordination service at NorthHaven Church, April 27, 2014.
Lord Jesus,
Children take what is given them
With joy and gratitude,
Without pretense,
Never second-guessing
The motives of the giver.
You told us that we must
Receive the Kingdom as a little child,
Yet our pride keeps us from accepting
That which you offer by the hands of your servants.
Teach us to receive the gifts of ministry</description>

For those who have given much
And have gone on to their eternal rest,
We give thanks.
For those who labor joyfully
So that others may see Jesus,
We give thanks.
For both laughter and tears,
When shared with those who love deeply,
We give thanks.
And for a church where Christ is proclaimed
Yet an Imam feels welcome,
We give thanks.

      <description>God of grace and love,
History is filled
With names like
Alexander,
Hannibal,
Caesar,
Napoleon;
Men who took up arms,
And with violence,
Bent the world to their will.
But history whispers
Of others,
The faceless ones,
Who were deemed
To insignificant to name.
We think of the woman
Who, with her daughter,
Gave her son to the Nile,
Yet found a way to get him back,
And by saving her son,</description>

tried in vain to find her in the Exodus story.

Comforted us during the times of loss,

Those who have given their lives for their country&amp;rsquo;s sake,
Those who sacrificed their own comfort so that others may prosper,</description>

Of one who was
Ugly,
Despised,
Rejected,
One who knew pain,
And suffering,
One upon whom people would look,
Then turn away in disgust.
Yet it was our pain he bore,
And our ugliness he assumed,
Taking upon himself
The shameful things inside
That we keep hidden.
We are like those

There were two couples there that, generally with some other couples, return every year. Before dinner, everyone met for some refreshments, during which they told about their usual evening activity at the inn. Evidently, the first time that the couples had been at the inn together, they found themselves in that room making the sort of small talk that people do when they don&amp;rsquo;t really know each other.</description>

      <description>God of grace,
We live in a word of concrete barricades, wooden fences, and stone walls that we have built to protect, separate, control, and hide; some hastily thrown up in hours, others carefully built in weeks or months.
Other walls, though, are constructed over a lifetime, and are just as real and just as effective—downcast eyes, hostile stares, and stony silence—walls constructed to prevent the pain of rejection, or to keep others out of our comfortable lives.</description>

      <description>Social media was certainly inundated with reactions to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Supreme Court ruling in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby. The majority were at the two extremes&amp;mdash;either this was a great victory for religious liberty and a stunning blow to the Obama administration, or it was an unprecedented power-grab by religious conservatives and wealthy corporate America that will only prevent women from getting the health care that they need.
As is generally the case, neither extreme position is correct.</description>

Here is the prayer for the week:
A good actor devotes herself to her role,
and carefully learns her lines;
while constantly studying the finest
performances of the past.
At first, after many missed cues
and fumbled lines,
she fears she may never get it right.
But with wise direction,
and hours of rehearsing,

Roughly a year ago, the Army changed its email service to an Exchange Enterprise system.

It seems, though, that links in forwarded emails are stripped out for security purposes.</description>

      <description>When we discuss the concept of rights in political philosophy, I confess that I feel conflicted. On one hand, the recognition of, and commitment to, the rights of others is essential to treating them with the dignity that is due to one created in the image of God. On the other hand, the constant practice of demanding my own rights does not seem consistent with the claim to follow the one that Paul described in Philippians 2:</description>

      <description>I hear reports of violence and injustice,
and give thanks that I do not live in those places.
I see images of the hungry and ill,
and rejoice in my satisfaction and plenty.
My prayers are just fervent enough,
my compassion just tender enough,
my charity just generous enough,
my heart just cold enough.
Father,
forgive me,
and cleanse me of the sin
of being just enough.
Amen</description>

      <description>Loving God,
Apathy is a vice
easily disguised
behind veils
of busy lives,
carefully built
to avoid the
demands of love.
Forgive me,
not just because
I pretend to care,
but that I
deceive myself -
believing in
the pretending
more than
in the caring.
Amen</description>

      <description>Sheri and I recently spent the weekend with some soldiers from my Afghanistan deployment and their families. I wrote this prayer after reflecting on the experience:
God of promise and hope,
We give thanks today for shared memories.
The stories bring healing
as they are told and retold,
for they remind us
that joy is found in surprising places.
Cherish our remembering,
and strengthen our minds
as the years pass,</description>

      <description>I love it when a minister points out something that I had never noticed in the text. Mitch Randall certainly did that this past Sunday. So, this prayer recalls Daniel&amp;rsquo;s action to save his competitors in Babylon as recounted in Daniel 2.
If there is to be a winner, there must be a loser. or so it goes in the games we play, in games of sport, and in games of life.</description>

      <description>In response to a sermon on Daniel 3:
How shall we respond to the furnaces of life? We make empty promises, saying that God must deliver, Mere feeble attempts to bind God&amp;rsquo;s will With pledges that we cannot guarantee.
Instead, we are called to be strong and courageous, And if rescue is promised, Then of what value is courage?
Lord, Give us the strength to face the flames Like the three in Babylon, Who dared not promise to show what God would do for them, But promised instead to show what they would do for God.</description>

      <description>As I was driving to work this morning, the person behind me honked as I was waiting for a pedestrian to cross the street at a marked crosswalk. I was still fuming and telling myself that I wish I could have told them what I really thought as they pulled into the parking space beside me. Fortunately, I had just heard Mitch Randall&amp;rsquo;s sermon on Daniel in the lions&amp;rsquo; den the day before.</description>

      <description>We missed worship at NorthHaven this past Sunday, although I hear that there was an exceptional sermon by Bryan Partridge. Instead, I was at the 2014 meeting of the Baptist Association of Philosophy Teachers. A common theme of the presentations that I heard was the virtue of humility, one that seems often missing from academic life. This week&amp;rsquo;s prayer:
Holy God,
Protect me from the temptation to mistake sarcasm for honesty, cynicism for realism, and cleverness for wisdom.</description>

      <description>Holy God,
Examine our hearts,
and test our wills
against your own.
We pray for the coming of your Kingdom
here, on earth,
even as it is in heaven.
Yet we confess that sometimes,
these are just sounds made with our voices,
not reflections of the desires of our hearts.
For in that day,
the high shall be brought down
and the low shall be lifted up
and compared to most,</description>

Why do you continue to use me? What good am I to you?
I am a flawed, broken, undependable tool.
One that makes mistakes, and asks for second chances.
But I hear a gentle voice whispering a message of hope, that my heart longs to hear&amp;hellip;
That even a flawed and broken tool can make something beautiful when it&amp;rsquo;s used by the master.</description>

Comfortable,
not too demanding,
painless,
and safe&amp;hellip;
Easy to forget&amp;hellip;
The kind you never
know is there,
with just a little Jesus,
and not too much of the Spirit.
A faith that trusts,
but not too much.
A faith that dreams,
but not too big.
But the living God
does not deal in small faith
and small dreams.</description>

Stay with me
for a moment
while I divide
up my life.
I&amp;rsquo;ll give you Sunday,
but I&amp;rsquo;m keeping
Monday through Saturday.
I&amp;rsquo;ll give you ten percent,
so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t
ask what I do with
the other ninety.
I&amp;rsquo;ll do whatever you ask,
just don&amp;rsquo;t make any
unreasonable demands.
Then, in the stillness,
I hear a quiet voice
whisper the question
I&amp;rsquo;m afraid to answer:
 Why do you call me &amp;ldquo;Lord?</description>

frozen into place.
They wore expressions,
not of who they really were,

We call our masks
by different names:
Facebook,
Twitter,
Social media;
still used to
project an image,
one that even we ourselves
can eventually come to believe.
Lord Jesus, you summed up the law and

 At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. &amp;ldquo;I believed that you were a friend before the letter came,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;or at least I wished to.</description>

In the events of this year,
we see how fragile our lives truly are.
Daily, we are faced with a choice
to be people who live in cynicism and despair,
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.
On this day, we choose gratitude over despair,
and lift our hearts in thanksgiving to you,
the one who is the source of all good things.
Thank you
for family and friends,</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Casie Trotter sent me this quote from George Saunders: &amp;ldquo;I think that art is a form of paying attention and, for me, attention is love.&amp;rdquo; This is an important point, although I would phrase it differently. Attention is not love, because attention can easily be followed by an act of hate. Attention is a necessary condition of love; it is impossible to love something unless on pays attention to the object of love.</description>

      <description>Jesus saw the lame man at the pool,
and asked, &amp;ldquo;Do you want to be made well?&amp;rdquo;
Instead of an answer,
the man gave an explanation.
But explanations become rationalizations,
and rationalizations become excuses,
and &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; just means &amp;ldquo;No, thank you.&amp;rdquo;
Lord,
Forgive us for preferring
the familiarity of the present pain
to the joy of new life that you offer.

do I use them,
or do they use me?

      <description>For years now, It seems like I have been searching for the perfect text editor. Evidently, there are those who believe that there is one single perfect text editor for everyone. If you need evidence, just search the Internet for &amp;#8220;Vim vs. Emacs.&amp;#8221; My experience, though, leads to me believe that, when it comes to text editors, like many other tools, perfection is relative to the individual. What tool is needed depends on how the individual writer works and thinks.</description>

      <description>Cultural Relativism For many of those that hold the position, cultural relativism is motivated by a belief that we should be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Most of the time, this is expressed in a way that is simply inconsistent, that is, given that there are no objective, universal moral truths, we ought to be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Unfortunately, one cannot consistently assert both that there are no objective, universal, moral truths and that we have a moral obligation to be tolerant, especially since our culture is often intolerant.</description>

      <description>I have been using Keynote for iOS for lecture presentations in classes this semester. The process has been so easy, that this is the first semester that I have consistently used slide presentations during lectures. Most of my presentations were initially prepared on the Mac, then imported into Keynote for iOS on the iPad. Keynote for iOS seems to be fairly adept at importing transitions and effects. My only complaint is that the default font used in my preferred theme is different in the iOS version than in the desktop version of Keynote.</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving should be an opportunity for reflection, not for the gluttony and sloth that has become the norm. One of my favorite Thanksgiving traditions to share the latest world hunger statistics with my Introduction to Philosophy class. I then urge the students to spend the break reading Ron Sider’s book, Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger.
This past week reminded me of how fortunate I am to be able to share my time with both students and colleagues.</description>

      <description>I was having some trouble with BBEdit on one of my machines, so I decided to delete and reinstall the application. That’s not very difficult in ordinary circumstances, but since I bought from the App Store, it should have been even easier. There should be no need to enter any license information, just a click and install.
First, I deleted the app. I deleted BBEdit from the applications folder. Somehow, it was still in Launchpad.</description>

      <description>Apparently, there are many discussing what to expect on May 21. Of course, it&#39;s not the first time that the end of the world has been predicted. Bill Leonard, professor of church history at Wake Forest, recently posted an article at Associated Baptist Press reviewing past mistaken predictions. Note the final two paragraphs:
 For now, let’s keep last things last. The end will come, for individuals and ultimately for the entire enterprise, but perhaps the answers lie, not in escapist theories, but with dying whales, vanishing forests, polluted water and rising ozone, “the fire next time.</description>

From Tony Schwarz&#39;s post titled &#34;Sleep is More Important than Food&#34; at the Harvard Business Review:
 &amp;hellip;In reality, the research suggests that even small amounts of sleep deprivation take a significant toll on our health, our mood, our cognitive capacity and our productivity.
Many of the effects we suffer are invisible. Insufficient sleep, for example, deeply impairs our ability to consolidate and stabilize learning that occurs during the waking day.</description>

In today&amp;rsquo;s Washington Post, Petula Dvorak&amp;rsquo;s column includes a story about a 6-year-old who was told by her mother to scale back her Christmas list. So, she wrote a letter to &amp;ldquo;Dear Sata&amp;rdquo; asking for just one thing, a remote control that controlled the world.
When her mother pointed out that the salutation was missing an &amp;ldquo;N&amp;rdquo;, she simply added it to the end of the name.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, the story goes, a preacher ran through the streets of the city shouting, &#39;We must put God into our lives. We must put God into our lives.&#39; And hearing him, the old monastic rose up in the city plaza to say, &#39;No, sir, you are wrong. You see, God is already in our lives. Our task is simply to recognize that.&#39; Joan Chittister</description>

 Be seen reading the grittier classics of Christian literature. Though Blue Like Jazz is an almost irresistible first choice, try for something more subtle, like Flannery O’Connor, J.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been following the debate over the proposed Mosque near the site of the World Trade Center in New York City. Baptists have historically been champions of religious liberty, and denying Muslims the right to build a house of worship is contrary to historic Baptist principles.
The question to ask is this - would you be happy with a Christian Church at the same location? If so, then do not deny Muslim-Americans the same rights that you are willing to give Christian-Americans.</description>

I want nothing to do with your religion projects,

I&amp;rsquo;m sick of your fund-raising schemes,
your public relations and image making.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had all I can take of your noisy ego-music.
When was the last time you sang to me?
Do you know what I want?
I want justice—oceans of it.</description>

      <description>There is, in a word, nothing comfortable about the Bible &amp;ndash; until we manage to get so used to it that we make it comfortable for ourselves. But then we are perhaps too used to it and too at home in it. Let us not be too sure we know the Bible &amp;hellip; just because we have learned not to have problems with it. Have we perhaps learned &amp;hellip; not to really pay attention to it?</description>

The highlight of the visit was a trip to Ft. Moultrie on Sullivan&#39;s Island. The defense of the fort in 1776 was the first major victory over the British in the Revolutionary War. Standing on the high ground at Ft. Moultrie, you can look straight across the harbor and see Ft.</description>

      <description>From a briefing given by an Army Chaplain about the new Inter-service Chaplain Center that is shared by the Army, Navy, and Air Force:
&#34;We didn&#39;t foresee the challenges that we would have with a building shared by the three services. Each service has its own customs, traditions, and even language. For example, we had to order three different signs for the restrooms - one that said &#39;Latrine&#39; for the Army, &#39;Head&#39; for the Navy, and &#39;Powder Room&#39; for the Air Force.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m back at the Chaplains&#39; School for the first time in seven years. One of my classmates for this course asked me today if I was a runner. He said that I looked like someone who passed him on a 5-K in Baghdad. We were stationed on the same base at the same time, so I guess it was me. In honor of those memories, I posted a photo of the 378th Baghdad Army Ten-Miler group.</description>

      <description>The New York Times recently reported on a study published in Psychological Science suggesting that people who engage in substantive, meaningful conversations are happier than those who do not.
It appears that Mill was right — it is better to be a dissatisfied Socrates than a satisfied pig.</description>

      <description>Every February, Oklahoma Baptist University celebrates Founders&#39; Day with a special chapel service. This year&#39;s service was particularly special, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the school&#39;s founding. The service included a reenactment of W.P. Blake and G. Lee Phelps kneeling in prayer on the site in Shawnee, Oklahoma that was to become Oklahoma Baptist University. To be honest, I can now remember only a single sentence from either prayer, but it is a sentence that I don&#39;t think I will ever forget: &#34;</description>

      <description>Recently, I posted a quote on the Tumblr page from Jaroslav Pelikan: &#34;The only alternative to tradition is bad tradition.&#34; At the time, I realized it needed some explanation, but posted it anyway. Some comments show that the quote is meaningless without some context.
John Mouracade pointed out that it looks like a false dilemma. A false dilemma is a fallacy committed when one asserts that at least one of two different alternatives must be true, but ignores other alternatives that might also be true.</description>

      <description>A problem we looked at in Critical Thinking today asked why most car accidents occur close to home. The answer is that most of our driving is close to home. The problem then asked us to explain that in terms of conditional probabilities. I don&#39;t think that I explained it very well, so let me take another shot at it.
Remember the definition of conditional probability: Pr(A|B) = Pr(A&amp;amp;B)/Pr(B).
Let&#39;s assume that 90% of driving is close to home and 10% is not.</description>

      <description>Another package arrived in the mail today, wrapped in tissue paper with my address scrawled in permanent marker. Is it art? Let&#39;s consider the theories that are in contention.
Art as mimesis - No human being has eyes like that, so it&#39;s a bad imitation.
Art as expression - Surely the artist couldn&#39;t have been experiencing the same emotion that I&#39;m experiencing as I look on these. I wouldn&#39;t wish that on any human being.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I received an anonymous package by campus mail that contained this. I assume it was sent by a student in my Aesthetics class. It&#39;s a good example of an adequacy condition for an aesthetic theory — any theory that claims that this is good art must be rejected.
What should I do to get even? Maybe we&#39;ll have to reinstate those daily presentations.</description>

      <description>Triumph of the Will, directed by Leni Riefenstahl, is the film that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember in Aesthetics this morning. Roger Ebert, in his 1994 review of a documentary about Riefenstahl asks exactly the right question:
 &amp;ldquo;These are by general consent two of the best documentaries ever made. But because they reflect the ideology of a monstrous movement, they pose a classic question of the contest between art and morality: Is there such a thing as pure art, or does all art make a political statement?</description>

      <description>Online education more effective than classroom? From the NY Times: &amp;ldquo;A recent 93-page report on online education, conducted by SRI International for the Department of Education, has a starchy academic title, but a most intriguing conclusion: &amp;lsquo;On average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;

In my opinion, The Stanford Encyclopedia is the best reference work in philosophy, not simply the best online reference work in philosophy. I’ve been slowly working on a paper on the Trinity, so I’m grateful to have a nice summary of recent work on the subject. </description>

      <description>There’s an interesting piece in the New York Times today about student expectations and grade inflation. Apparently, there are students (at institutions other than Oklahoma Baptist, I’m sure) that believe that doing the minimal work that is required of everyone in the course should be sufficient to earn a B for the course. Either we have lowered the level of work that we are willing to consider average, or it really is true that in today’s society someone who manages to complete the minimum requirements really is above average.</description>

      <description>Two stories in today’s news caught my attention. First, Britain’s The Independent reports on history’s most famous failed technology predictions. These include a claim from 1977 that no one will need a computer in their home.
The second story, in the Washington Post, is a harrowing account of an assault conducted by U. S. Special Forces soldiers and Afghan commandos on an insurgent stronghold in Afghanistan. Ten of those soldiers will receive the Silver Star today.</description>

      <description>One of the assignments in Critical Thinking was to figure the probability of winning the prize in the traditional three-door Monty Hall problem. Remember that there are three doors for you, the contestant, to choose from, but only one has the prize. The host knows what door the prize is behind, and opens another door to show you that there is nothing there. He will open neither the one you pick nor the one that has the prize.</description>

In June, Medgar Evers, the NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi, was murdered outside his home. In August, Martin Luther King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.</description>

      <description>In Ethics, Friday, I sketched out an argument against moral relativism that appeals to the standard argument for moral relativism. The following is a typical argument for moral relativism:
There is widespread disagreement about ethical claims. There is no rational way to settle this disagreement. If there is no rational way to settle a disagreement concerning a claim, then we should deny that such claims are objectively true. Therefore, ethical claims are not objectively true.</description>

      <description>In Philosophy of Mind today, I claimed that the ability to respond to the environment meant that an organism was at least minimally conscious. Michael Novotny then asked if that entailed that certain mechanisms were conscious. For example, a trap door opens when a certain weight is place on it. It seems to be responding to the environment, so does that mean that it is conscious? If not, then what&#39;s wrong with my claim about the condition for minimal consciousness?</description>

At least hate is an acknowledgment of the existence and importance of the other person.</description>

      <description>If you have writing projects that require footnotes, endnotes, bibliographies, or other kinds of references, you should consider getting some kind of reference manager software. Short papers with a few references are easy enough to manage with a word processor alone, but significant projects can easily be overwhelming. There is enough pain in academic writing that one does not need the extra suffering caused by having to make sure that every work cited is included in the bibliography, that the entries are all in alphabetical order, and that the notes and bibliography entries are all in the right format.</description>

      <description>Both presidential candidates seem to be stressing the importance of adopting policies that are good for the middle class. I have to admit that such talk resonates with me, probably because I am a member of the middle class. Today, though, I saw a title of a blog post by Adam Taylor that is making me rethink my assumptions about the priority of the middle class.
It was titled &#34;Just as You Did for the Middle Class, You Also Did for Me.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The summit on soaring food prices ended last week. For years, I have read that there is plenty of food available to feed everyone on the planet, but the problem was distributing that food. We know from recent events in Myanmar that uncooperative regimes can make aid distribution impossible. Now, though, it seems that there is a genuine food shortage, not simply a problem of distribution. What has changed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Washington Post reports something today that is unfortunate but unsurprising. NASA&#39;s inspector general has determined that political appointees have controlled and distorted information about research on climate change conducted by NASA scientists. This is why it is so difficult for the layperson like myself to make informed decisions about the severity of the problem and the best response to the problem. Such decisions should be made on the basis of the best science, but what we know about the science has been distorted by those who have already decided what is to be done.</description>

      <description>We had a wonderful week in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country filled with charming people. We had a tour of the rain forest canopy and two bus trips through the countryside. If you ever plan a trip to Costa Rica, consider avoiding the rainy season. It did rain every day while we were there, but cleared up beautifully, of course, on the day that we left.
While we were on the bus traveling to the rain forest, our guide, Oliver, gave us a lesson on the history, geography, and culture of the country.</description>

      <description>We are leaving tomorrow for a week in Costa Rica. We&#39;re all looking forward to a wonderful trip. Costa Rica should be quite a bit different than anywhere I&#39;ve been recently. I&#39;ll post some pictures when we get back.</description>

      <description>I am a Baptist who is committed to religious freedom, and I think that the separation of church and state is critical for maintaining religious freedom. I also believe in the value of the classical liberal tradition, in which everyone should have the freedom to choose their own values and act to achieve what they think is good, provided that it does not interfere with another&#39;s ability to do the same.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Mitch Randall, pastor of NorthHaven Church in Norman, preached on Christianity and Justice. In his message, he discussed the Millennium Development Goals, seven goals that have been adopted by the world&#39;s countries, including the United States. It is legitimate for the church to ask what we can do to help our own nation achieve its stated goals.
The eight goals are outlined on the United Nations Website:
1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</description>

      <description>It&#39;s finally over. After a year, I am back at home with Sheri and Rachael. Thanks for all of your thoughts and prayers over the past year. Please continue to pray for:
 The safety of the many soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and civilians who remain in harm&#39;s way The psychological health of those who have returned The families who heroically endure long separations The thousands of families who mourn the loss of a loved one who died in combat The people of Iraq, who deserve lives of prosperity and peace.</description>

      <description>We have made it back to the place where all of our training began - Ft. Dix, New Jersey. After a few days in Kuwait, we began the long process of clearing customs and awaiting transportation. We landed at Maguire Air Force Base on Tuesday. We had to walk across a lawn to get on a bus that was waiting to take us to Ft. Dix. It was wonderful to smell grass once again.</description>

      <description>This should be my last post from Iraq. Soon, we will move out of our trailers and into some tents, awaiting our flight to Kuwait. As I prepared this morning&#39;s sermon, it struck me that most of the Old Testament was written with this place as a context. I won&#39;t give you the whole sermon, but here are some of the lessons that I&#39;ve learned.
First, the practical lessons: 1) You can lose your tolerance for spicy food.</description>

      <description>We have made it to our last full week in Iraq. I was never very interested in prophecy about the future, but lately I have been thinking a lot about eschatology, or the study of last things. Today, I thought about the last time I will change the sheets on the bed here, or the last time I do a PT run down &#34;Sniper Alley.&#34; I wonder if today is the last time that the rockets come in, but given the way things are in Basra right now, I somehow doubt it.</description>

      <description>It was a beautiful early spring day in Baghdad today. The high was only 99. Fortunately, we&#39;ll be long gone before it gets in the 120&#39;s. On a recent trip, I made it within two miles of the ruins of ancient Babylon. Unfortunately, it was too dangerous to visit the ruins. Tradition maintains that the house that Abraham lived in before he left on his journey of faith is at Tallil, which is in southeastern Iraq.</description>

      <description>I just finished the Good Friday Tenebrae service. The Tenebrae, or Service of Shadows, has always been a very meaningful service for me. It is a very somber service, as is fitting on Good Friday. A reader reads a passage of Scripture associated with the betrayal, crucifixion, or burial of Jesus, and then blows out one of the candles that provides light for the service. As the readings progress further into the Passion story, the room grows progressively darker.</description>

      <description>Palm Sunday has passed, and we are moving into the most solemn period in the church calendar. As we enter this time of reflection concerning the sacrifice of Christ, think about these results of a recent poll by the Pew Research Center. Last August, 54% of Americans polled knew the approximate number of American military personnel that had been killed in Iraq, a percentage that had held steady since the beginning of the war.</description>

      <description>I guess that it&#39;s time to post some updates. I have been very busy lately, trying to visit all of my soldiers before I turn them over to another chaplain. After my unit had been here for four months, we were given responsibility for about 400 active duty soldiers. They will be here for eight more months after we leave. This week, I made my last troop visitation trip.
Today is the first day of a dust storm that is predicted to last for several days.</description>

      <description>Our winter season has passed, I believe. I know that those of you in the central US won&#39;t feel that low temperatures in the high 30&#39;s really deserve to be called &#34;winter.&#34; Remember, though, that you don&#39;t have to walk 50 yards from your house to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
The high on Monday is supposed to be 93 degrees. So, winter has passed, summer is here, and I don&#39;t recall spring.</description>

      <description>We have been working very hard to turn in any equipment that we won&#39;t need in the time we have left here. It&#39;s exciting to be preparing to go home. Going home presents a new set of challenges for chaplains. I have to make sure that the soldiers understand how to cope with the stresses of plugging back into &#34;normal&#34; life while trying to leave the war behind.
Along those lines, I have read some disturbing articles recently.</description>

      <description>A group of my soldiers declared February to be &#34;Mustache Month.&#34; They all grew mustaches, some fairly impressive, and others decidedly less so. They will shave them tomorrow, March 1. This morning, they gathered for a picture and a small ceremony. For some reason, they asked me if I would say a few words on this solemn occasion.
So, what does one say to mark the passing of a mustache? You can leave your thoughts in a comment if you like.</description>

      <description>It has been raining all afternoon. The rain turns the clay into mud that has the consistency of peanut butter. I think I&#39;ll sit in the trailer and watch an old Hitchcock film tonight. First, I&#39;ll give a little update about my last two weeks.
I just got back back from a trip north near Saddam&#39;s ancestral home. It reminded me of eastern Colorado with flat brown land and mountains that were visible in the distance.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been back for a week now, and there have been some changes. One change is that my trailer is surrounded by blast walls that are 12 feet high. These concrete monoliths are all over the country. I can imagine some future archaeologist wondering about the purpose of these great stone artifacts, and debating about whether we would have, given time, reached the sophisticated level of the Easter Island culture.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m back after enduring another three days of travel. After we arrived at Ali al Salim Air Base in Kuwait, a captain that I was walking with said, &#34;It seems strangely reassuring to be back.&#34; I replied, &#34;You&#39;re right, and that&#39;s more than a little bit sad.&#34; We have all become used to being here, and now the familiarity is reasurring in its own way. We find the familiar to be comfortable, while the unfamiliar is uncomfortable.</description>

Those are things like having a bathroom in the same building as your bedroom, showers that are big enough to turn around in, and being able to just jump in the car and drive anywhere you like. We don&#39;t have any big plans for the next two weeks.</description>

      <description>I was surprised to open my trailer door Friday morning and see snow. I never expected to see snow in Baghdad. Evidently, it was the first snow in a century. All the Americans were walking around singing &#34;I&#39;m Dreaming of a White Christmas&#34; or some variation. The Iraqis were just staring. Some of the Iraqis didn&#39;t have a word for it; they just called it &#34;white rain.&#34; People spoke of it being a sign from God, but I never could find out what they thought it signified.</description>

      <description>I lost my pianist for chapel last week. He is the division surgeon for the First Cavalry Division. For some reason, he declined to extend his tour to keep playing for my chapel service. So, I&#39;ve been moving through the customary stages of grief: from denial, anger, and bargaining, to where I&#39;m at now, which is some combination of depression and acceptance. I was forced to play the piano myself this morning, forcing even more Soldiers to suffer for their country.</description>

After work on Christmas Eve, I organized a little fellowship gathering behind the building. We ate some snacks, threw horseshoes and darts, and talked around a fire. We then went to the palace for the base candlelight service. The Tongan Marine Choir sang, and everyone had a wonderful time.</description>

      <description>I think we&#39;re all getting tired. I know I am. In the old days (that&#39;s back when I first joined the Army, 24 years ago), everyone had a countdown, or short-timer&#39;s, calendar. It was a way to keep a running count of how many days you had left in a tour, enlistment, prison-sentence, etc. Some things never change, they just evolve technologically. Now, everyone keeps a spreadsheet that tracks the number of remaining days automatically.</description>

      <description>I have survived my three days of combat lifesaver training. The second day was mostly spent learning how to give IV&#39;s. On the third day, we had a mass-casualty exercise. Giving someone an IV in a classroom is pretty easy. It&#39;s a lot more difficult when the patient is on a stretcher on the ground in the sand as other people are yelling and screaming. My patients survived, though, and don&#39;t quite look like human pincushions.</description>

      <description>I began a three day combat lifesaver&#39;s course today. The highlight of the day was having a six inch rubber hose shoved up my nose. It&#39;s something called a nasal pharyngeal airway, and is designed to keep a patient&#39;s airway open. The sadists teaching the course maintain that you can&#39;t really give one to someone else unless you know how it feels to have it done to you. It goes up the nose, all the way in, until you feel it on the back of your tongue.</description>

      <title>In Defense of Subversiveness</title>

      <guid>http://randyridenour.net/2007/12/07/in-defense-of-subversiveness/</guid>
      <description>I recently remarked that a little subversiveness has always been good for the country. Of course, this was meant as a joke, so it&#39;s somewhat foolish for me to try to defend the claim. Whether the claim is true depends on how &#34;subversive&#34; is defined. I&#39;m sure that there are many different lexical definitions of &#34;subversive,&#34; but, if I remember correctly the word comes from the Latin subvertere, meaning literally &#34;</description>

I&#39;m not sure why, but it might be to minimize the possibility of anyone reading Bruce Prescott&#39;s blog on a government machine. They just don&#39;t realize that a little subversiveness is always good for the country. It does make it difficult to post anything new.

I got to the airfield to find out that the flight was canceled. Apparently, there were no other flights available. I&#39;m not disappointed for two reasons. First, I found out yesterday that I would have to go up there in two weeks to spend a week or so. The base chaplain there is leaving and is not being replaced.</description>

      <description>I baptized someone in the 7:00 service this morning. It&#39;s an exciting time in the life of a small congregation, and a good reminder that God continues to work in the lives of people, even here. I have to confess that it was a baptism by sprinkling; a hard thing for a professor at a Baptist college to admit to having done. It&#39;s a good thing I teach philosophy and not Christian Doctrines.</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving began with a 10K race here at the camp. I finished in 52 minutes. Needless to say, I did not win. I did have a good time, though. We had a special Thanksgiving service at 11:00, which was followed by dinner. The dining facilities were decorated very nicely. Then, it was back to work. I walked around the work areas and talked with the troops. Everyone is doing very well.</description>

      <description>Abraham Lincoln said, &#34;I sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is, but it does not admit of holidays.&#34; We have worked through Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, and will work through Thanksgiving and Christmas. My last day off was during the four-day pass that we had in late June. There are occasional feelings of terror and frequent times of hilarity, but the most common emotional state here is simply weariness.</description>

      <description>I know that most of America thinks that we are suffering horribly here. In the interests of full disclosure, I feel that I should reveal that tonight, every Friday evening in fact, is steak and lobster night at one of the dining facilities. The other dining facility has their steak on Wednesdays. There is occasional suffering though, sometimes there&#39;s no lobster, just crab legs.
I never thought war would be bad for one&#39;s waistline.</description>

      <description>Veterans Day has come and gone. I attended a very moving ceremony today. Ryan Crocker, the ambassador to Iraq, was the speaker. Generals from Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. lay wreaths to commemorate the fallen.
I have conducted many funerals and memorial services of Soldiers since this war began. I remember picking up a book in the bookstore once that contained the last letters written home by many Soldiers and Marines.</description>

People nationwide will remember to thank veterans for their service. This year, remember to also thank their families. The burdens they are asked to carry can be unbearable sometimes. If you happen to see my family tomorrow, give them a hug, and tell them it&#39;s from me.</description>

So, I&#39;ll just say that I spent part of a recent morning face-down in the dirt having some serious prayer time. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. I am looking forward to going home where the most exciting thing that happens is when the pizza delivery man drives across my yard. There&#39;s much to be said for a long, dull life.</description>

Thanks, Joshua, I&#39;m with you, especially on that third one!
Jocelyn writes,

      <description>One thing I love about the chaplaincy is the chance to associate with, worship with, and learn from people from different traditions in Christianity. Today, I chaired a monthly meeting of the ministers from the various congregations. In attendance were a minister from the Gospel congregation, an Episcopal priest, a Roman Catholic priest, a Southern Baptist, and me. The Episcopalian led the devotional, and we had a wonderful time.
It&#39;s nice to be in a place where denominational differences are used as icebreakers to build bridges to other people, not to isolate us from the rest of the Church.</description>

      <description>The trouble with being a chaplain is that you can&#39;t talk much about the details of your work. There are some issues that you could pray for, though. Pray that we will all experience more open communication, find healthy ways to address conflict, and develop renewed attitudes of respect and understanding for each other.
 Pray also for some time to write a sermon for Sunday...</description>

Thirty military amputees ran the race, calling themselves the &#34;Parts Missing in Action&#34; group. A great testimony to the perserverance and strength of will of the American Soldier.
We had an official ten-miler shadow run here on the base. Seven of us ran, and all seven completed the race.</description>

      <description>I generally use the Revised Common Lectionary when I preach. The lectionary is a set of readings for use in the service on Sunday. It is on a three year cycle, and each day has an Old Testament reading, a Psalm, a reading from the Gospels, and a reading from the rest of the New Testament. Lectionary use is fairly rare in my tradition, but I think that it has two advantages.</description>

      <description>I recently attended a screening of an interesting documentary, Meeting Resistance. A British and and an American interviewed a dozen insurgents about their reasons for fighting the Americans. One thing that is clear upon watching the film is the difficulty of combating an insurgency that is composed of small, relatively independent cells. Another difficulty is countering the insurgents&#39; message that the Americans are simply an army of occupation. That makes winning popular support for the coalition and the Iraqi security forces more difficult.</description>

There are a large number of Australians stationed here, though. I&#39;ve enjoyed talking to them. Other countries are represented by one or two. There are a few Brits, but most of them are stationed farther south. There are soldiers from central European and Central American countries. A Marine unit from the Kingdom of Tonga arrived recently.</description>

Part of the challenge for everyone is keeping in good spirits when those important events of life occur. It&#39;s hard having a birthday, anniversary, or other significant event happen while you&#39;re away from home. You can celebrate with your adopted family here, but it&#39;s not the same as being home.</description>

The embassy is there, so there are a lot of civilians. It&#39;s not an isolated compound like the military bases, so you really feel like you are in an international city, not just an American outpost.
We spent an hour or so playing dominos and relaxing by one of the embassy pools.</description>

There&#39;s not a real theater on the base, so we thought that watching a movie and having some popcorn will be good for people&#39;s spirits. My office had a big screen TV in it that I never used, so we moved it into one of the larger offices.</description>

      <description>Thanks for the jokes. So far, they have come from my sister, Rhonda, and her husband, Mark. I&#39;m not sure I can use the Quaker jokes. I might offend any Quakers in the unit. On the other hand, I suppose there aren&#39;t many good Quakers in the Army, it being a pacifist tradition...
As you can see from one of his responses below, he is asking for prayer for my sister as she undergoes medical tests.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, tensions can run pretty high at staff meetings. The staff officers work long hours and never get a whole day off. We each try to get away a half-day once a week, but that isn&#39;t always possible. When we mobilized in May, I began telling a joke or a humorous story at each staff meeting. My stories are pretty popular, and the presentation order quickly changed so that I closed the meeting.</description>

      <title>September 11</title>

      <description>It is September 11, and we took some time out of the day to reflect upon the events that led to our being here. As we did, events happened here that vividly reminded us how fragile our lives are. War and disease both have the consequence of forcing us to rethink our priorities. I am a materialist from a materialistic culture, but the only thing I really want is to go home to see my family again.</description>

      <description>As the old line goes, I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news first: it&#39;s boring. I&#39;m on one of the largest bases in the country, and there is very little to do here. I was talking to one of my soldiers recently; and he said that it could be worse, we could be in prison. Then he said, &#34;There&#39;s a wall around us, with barbed wire on top, and I don&#39;t do anything except work, eat, sleep, and go to the gym.</description>

      <title>Ethics and War - Part 2</title>

      <guid>http://randyridenour.net/2007/09/06/ethics-and-war-part-2/</guid>
      <description>War has always been morally complex. In freshman philosophy and upper-level ethics courses, we dream up wild ethical dilemmas that we use to test different moral theories. They are things like being forced to kill an innocent person or let other innocent people die. These dilemmas are interesting to talk about; but we don&#39;t worry about them too much, since we rarely face choices like that in normal life. Unfortunately, those dilemmas are common enough in war.</description>

      <title>A Christian in the Army</title>

      <guid>http://randyridenour.net/2007/09/02/a-christian-in-the-army/</guid>
      <description>To be honest, sometimes it is difficult reconciling Christianity with military service. People disagree about Jesus&#39; attitude towards war, but I think that people like John Howard Yoder and Walter Wink make a good case. The most obvious problem is that, regardless what we think Jesus meant, the early church was clearly committed to pacifism. That&#39;s not the problem that strikes me today, though.
One of the lectionary texts for today is the story of the banquet in Luke 14.</description>

      <description>I went to Taji last night to visit three soldiers. It was the wildest helicopter ride that I&#39;ve ever had. We went up, then down, then rolled onto the left side, then the right side, then shot some flares out, then repeated the cycle for an hour. Just when I thought I was going to lose my lunch, we landed. The guys there were grateful for the visit, so I guess it was worth it.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been a relatively easy couple of days here. That has given me some time to work on a small project for the corps chaplain&#39;s office. There are two chaplain&#39;s assistants who are headed to a meeting to discuss ethics issues in the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters, and I have been asked to provide some background material for them. I think that most of the discussion about ethical lapses in the current war miss an important point.</description>

      <description>Tim Youmans left a comment to a previous posting, so I had an opportunity to browse over to his blog. I saw a post concerning a major issue in philosophy of religion, and I couldn&#39;t help but leave a comment. It was sure nice to get to say something about philosophy. I&#39;m missing the excitement of the first few weeks of class right now. We have our own kind of excitement here, but it&#39;s just not the same.</description>

      <description>I had to call the office about a student&#39;s grade from last semester. I got to talk to several people back at the university. It was sure nice to hear some voices from home. I also got several messages and pictures from colleagues.
The best, though, is that I now have a working internet connection in my trailer. So, Sheri and I can make video calls through Skype. It&#39;s nice to be able to see the person as you speak.</description>

      <description>It was an exciting night last night. I had a Bible study in the office at 2000, and caught the 2100 bus back to my quarters. I live in a trailer pretty close to the edge of the camp. As I was walking from the bus stop through this open area to my trailer, a firefight (Armyese for &#34;gun battle&#34;) broke out outside the camp. I walked along watching tracers shoot through the sky in the distance.</description>

      <description>We just finished the prayer service at the battalion. This is a big base, and there are a lot of different services for different faith groups. So, there&#39;s a service for everyone, but some of my soldiers either don&#39;t feel that they can get away from the office, or they don&#39;t want to go to the chapel. So, we have our own small service at the battalion headquarters.
Sermon preparation is a challenge here.</description>

      <description>I may have committed the unpardonable sin. I threw two boxes of books in the dumpster. Or more accurately, I had the sergeant throw two boxes of books in the dumpster. This is the Army, after all.
Before I got here, I think I have only thrown away one book in my entire life. It was a copy of William Peter Blatty&#39;s book, The Exorcist, that I read in high school.</description>

      <description>War has probably always presented a good opportunity to reinvigorate one&#39;s prayer life. There are some large mosques nearby, and if you are out at the right time, you can hear the call to prayer very clearly. I&#39;ve decided to use the sound of gunfire as a call to prayer. Several times a day, I hear gunfire from somewhere outside the walls, and try to say a prayer for those on both sides of the conflict, and also for those who are caught in the middle.</description>

      <description>After the desolate pictures of the desert in Kuwait, I thought you should see what difference some water makes. This is a picture from my last trip. We flew over this very nice date orchard and a few farms.
 I was out running this morning when an explosion shook the ground. I think I set a personal best time for three miles. It&#39;s amazing what a little motivation can do.</description>

      <description>Here are two pictures from the clinic that we go to on Saturdays. The first is a child who has a new toy. The second is of a group of teenagers who work there. They were just finishing up building a new wheelchair out of a plastic outdoor chair.
We could use some more toys, and we could really use some shoes, men&#39;s, women&#39;s and children&#39;s, to give away.
Pray for those who are struggling who just want a better life in a peaceful country.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t have much time to post anything today. I&#39;m leaving on a trip to visit some soldiers on another base. I don&#39;t think Sheri likes it much when I travel; for some reason, she wants me to keep the excitement level to a minimum. Here&#39;s a view of Baghdad from the helicopter on my last trip:
Thanks for your prayers, and I&#39;ll have another post in a couple of days.</description>

      <description>I managed to get a picture on today. Here is a picture of me in front of the office.
I&#39;ve really become attached to the exterior decorating scheme. I wonder how Sheri would feel about putting sandbags around the house when I get home?
I&#39;ve also found something that I might put in my office. The last vehicle in a convoy has a sign in Arabic and English that says &#34;</description>

I&#39;m both amazed and amused how soldiers can take something unpleasant and find a way to lift everyone&#39;s spirits. For example, I don&#39;t know how many of you have had the pleasure of using a Port-a-John that&#39;s been sitting in the sun on a 120 degree day.</description>

      <description>A former student, Caleb, left a comment to one of the last posts. Caleb is in seminary now, and is a chaplain candidate in the Oklahoma National Guard. There is a great shortage of military chaplains, especially in the Guard and Reserves. I&#39;m grateful for young ministers who are willing to consider and accept the call to chaplaincy service.
I need to point out that my blog posts don&#39;t really give you a good feeling for what I specifically do during the day.</description>

      <description>One of the best ministries that we have is essentially a convenience store in our office. People send care packages to us, and we stock the shelves with toiletries, snacks, writing paper, envelopes, and other goodies. We also have a bookcase filled with paperbacks, and another shelf full of DVD&#39;s that we sign out. On the wall is a dart board, and we have a TV and refrigerator full of cold water and Gatorade.</description>

If you know any dentists who would like to donate some dental cleaning equipment, then let me know.</description>

      <description>I am on a very large base in Baghdad. It was a hunting preserve of Saddam&#39;s, but he was probably only here 7 or 8 times total. My office is in a small trailer, where we provide cold bottles of water to soldiers and give them a place to relax. The cold water is important since the temperature is currently 118 degrees and will continue to rise through August.
 I was going to attach a picture of the office, but I&#39;m having trouble getting it to upload.</description>

      <description>The picture yesterday looked pretty barren. I have to admit, though, that the sunrises and sunsets over the desert were beautiful. I&#39;m preparing a sermon for Sunday on the role of the desert in Scripture. Significant events happened in the desert to Moses, Jesus, and others. Maybe God has things of spiritual significance in store for us.

      <description>I went to chapel this morning. For some reason, there is an expectation that the chaplains will attend chapel! It was a good service, although it was a bit strange to see the ushers all wearing 9 mm handguns. Maybe churches at home would have more success in meeting their annual budgets if the ushers would start packing heat.

      <description>Yesterday was a slow day. We had a very hard three days at the range, with little sleep. So, we enjoyed a slow day yesterday. I had a prayer meeting last night at 2130 (9:30 pm) and will also have one at the same time tonight and tomorrow. Who said Baptists don&#39;t have revivals anymore! Eight people were there, and we had a good prayer time.
Thank you for your prayers.</description>

      <description>We went to a training area in the middle of the desert for the last three days. It was just a few tents in the middle of the sand. There, we had some classes, the soldiers went to a short-range marksmanship range, and we went on a convoy exercise that had a bunch of IED&#39;s, civilians in a town, and other scenarios.
The weather was hot (big surprise, there), and the air conditioning wasn&#39;t working in the tents.</description>

      <description>I hear that the pastor wants to stick the congregation members. I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s going to get any volunteers. I think my congregation here just decided that the IV would be less painful than one of my sermons!
Today we had fun with a vehicle rollover simulator. Rollovers are a significant cause of injuries and death. The simulator is like a ride at the fair. It is the cab from a Hummvee that has been mounted on a machine that spins it on an axis that runs horizontally through the middle.</description>

      <description>First aid training today... I learned how to give an emergency tracheotomy with a pocket knife, and I gave someone an IV. Only got to practice the IV on an actual volunteer. For some reason, no one would volunteer for the other procedure. Sheri knows that I have a queasy stomach, so I&#39;m really surprised I managed to do the IV. It&#39;s one of those things that I&#39;m glad I can do, but hope I never have the chance.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve become a heavy drinker. I always travel with a water bottle in hand; and when I finish that one, I start another. The camp command requires that whenever a soldier becomes a heat casualty (heatstroke or heat exhaustion), the core body temperature must be taken immediately. I&#39;ll just say that this involves cutting away the back side of the uniform and putting a thermometer in places that we won&#39;t discuss.</description>

      <description>After about 24 hours of travel time (flying, waiting in terminals, etc.), we arrived in Kuwait. We will be here for nearly two weeks. It is hot, sandy, with more heat and a little (no, a lot) more sand. I wish I could describe how it looks. There are no trees, no grass, no vegetation at all. There is just sand. We have had a sandstorm for two days now. I feel like a bit player in an old Foreign Legion film.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s travel day today. We got to the airfield just after midnight, and the plane left at 4:30 AM. We had a stop to refuel in Canada, then flew to Germany. I got to see icebergs from the plane as we left Newfoundland. It&#39;s now 4:15 PM EDT, but just after 9 PM local time in Germany. The weather is nice and cool in both Newfoundland and Germany. We&#39;re wondering what the contrast will feel like when we reach our final destination.</description>

      <description>We&#39;re leaving tomorrow. We had a great picnic today with the unit and some of the families. Members of my church, NorthHaven Church in Norman, quickly responded to a plea for some funds to finance the meal. We cooked hamburgers, hot dogs, pulled pork, ribs, and chicken. We played volleyball and tossed some horseshoes. It was a great meal and a fun time. Everyone asked me to express their appreciation to the church.</description>

      <description>Sheri, Rachael, and I are spending four great days in Philadelphia. It has sure been nice to spend some time with them and to get away from all things Army. We spent the day today in the Philadelphia Art Museum. They have an excellent collection of Asian art, Medieval art, and an especially nice collection of 20th century art. I was particularly happy to see some well-known works by Duchamp and Mancusi.</description>

      <description>We leave today for a four-day pass! Tomorrow will be the first day off that we have had since May 6. Everyone is tired, but in great spirits and excited to see our families. Sheri and Rachael are flying to Philadelphia to meet me there, and we will spend four great days together. Very soon after that, I&#39;ll be flying east. I think everyone in the unit is ready to move on to new and exciting things.</description>

      <description>We just finished a three day exercise that was the last major training event we will have before we leave the states. The hours were long, so everyone is pretty tired. The exercise involves simulations of different scenarios that each section could face. Someone watches your response, and evaluates your actions. For me, the tasks were a suicide threat, a conscientious objector, and responding to some casualties. We did well, but I hope that we don&#39;t have to do it in real life.</description>

      <description>We moved out of the tents and back to our barracks. That means we&#39;ve moved back to the land of porcelain toilets and good internet connections. One is low-tech, the other high-tech, but both definitely beat no-tech. Everyone is excited to be out of the woods (literally, not figuratively). At our last staff meeting at the FOB, I shared Exodus 8:20 as the passage for the day:
&#34;Then the LORD said to Moses, &#39;Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh as he goes out to to the water, and say to him, &#34;</description>

      <description>Training is almost over. We just finished a three day exercise that covered base defense and combat convoy operations. Since chaplains can&#39;t carry weapons, I was tasked to be on the first aid/litter team for the base defense part and a driver on the convoy. It was fun, but a little stressful. When ordered, we drove our Humvee to the area where the casualty was, began first aid treatment, then loaded up the casualty on the stretcher and drove him back to the field hospital.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been a couple of days since I&#39;ve been able to get online. Friday, I went on a dismounted (no vehicles, the Army still speaks in horse cavalry terms) IED defense range. We were simulating a combat patrol down a road and into a village, and encountered three IED&#39;s on the route. When we found one, we were to take appropriate action.
I was going along with a group led by a young Staff Sergeant, when we spotted an IED.</description>

      <description>A good deal of our training here is designed to prepare us for one of the primary threats: the improvised explosive device, or IED. When we go anywhere outside the FOB (forward operating base), we have to move in a tactical convoy of at least two vehicles. Each vehicle has a driver, a person in the front passenger seat who is on the radio, and a gunner who stands up in the center hatch.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was a rainy day at the FOB. Rain is always a positive thing in Scripture, a sign of God&#39;s favor. Here, it has positive and negative aspects. Everything is muddy, and the rain comes through the open gunner&#39;s hatches on the vehicles when we are in a convoy. On the other hand, it is much cooler, and I&#39;m sure that in a month, we will be remembering 70 degree temperatures with fondness.</description>

      <description>I went to a range where my soldiers were qualifying on heavy machine guns and light automatic weapons. Since it was Sunday, we had services at the range. I had to conduct several services with small groups as they were available. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of the altar. I dropped the brushguard on our Humvee and placed the cross and communion cup on it. The sermon text was John 15:13, &amp;ldquo;No one has greater love than this, to lay down one&amp;rsquo;s life for one&amp;rsquo;s friends.</description>

I love you, still and always...</description>

      <description>Today is laundry day! Sheri, my wife, knows that I have never been excited about laundry before. Since we don&#39;t have washers at the training FOB (Forward Operating Base), we get to go back to main post to do laundry. At our building there, we also have air conditioning and a good internet connection. So, for the moment, laundry is a good thing.
It&#39;s amazing how one&#39;s priorities change relative to the circumstances.</description>

      <description>The unit had a night fire last night, and returned to the compound (affectionately known as cell block B) last night after midnight. We then got up at 4:00 this morning to go get smallpox shots and the second round of the anthrax shots. They then went to another live fire range immediately after the shots. I&#39;m not sure that giving real bullets to a bunch of ticked-off soldiers with less than four hours sleep is a good idea.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was my birthday. We convoyed from our beautiful home in the woods (see picture) to the main part of the base. The soldiers went to practice firing their weapons, and I walked down to the main chapel to pick up some communion supplies. When we got back, I stepped into the tent for a moment, and stepped out into a crowd. Somehow, the soldiers had managed to get a decorated cake out into the field.</description>

I hope to use this blog to let family (especially my loving, and much loved, wife and daughter) and friends know what I am doing.
For security reasons, I will not post specific details, but only general information concerning my experiences as an Army chaplain.</description>
