      <title>Open Dired From Shell</title>

      <description>I was browsing the interwebs this morning, looking for a way to open a Dired buffer of the current finder window. There is a lot on going the other way, from Emacs to the Finder, but nothing from the Finder to Emacs. I got this from Fortune Datko:
Add this to your shell rc file (in my case, .zshrc):
# open a dired window for the current directory dired() { emacsclient -e &amp;quot;(dired \&amp;quot;$PWD\&amp;quot;)&amp;quot; }  Then, assuming that Emacs server is running, type &amp;ldquo;dired&amp;rdquo; in the shell, and a Dired buffer of that directory opens in the current Emacs frame.</description>

      <title>Reloading zshrc</title>

      <description>I use zsh instead of bash. If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything to you, then just skip the rest of this post. I&amp;rsquo;ve been restarting the terminal after every change to my zshrc file. I knew there had to be a way to quickly reload the file without restarting the terminal.
It turns out that typing &amp;ldquo;. ~/.zshrc&amp;rdquo; will do it. The problem is that I&amp;rsquo;m not likely to remember it. I found this nice tip at codeM0nK3Y.</description>
