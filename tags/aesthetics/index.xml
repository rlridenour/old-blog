      <description>Another figurine arrived today. Evidently, the collection needed a little gender balance. Happy Thanksgiving to all of my extremely thoughtful Aesthetics students.</description>

      <description>Another package arrived in the mail today, wrapped in tissue paper with my address scrawled in permanent marker. Is it art? Let&#39;s consider the theories that are in contention.
Art as mimesis - No human being has eyes like that, so it&#39;s a bad imitation.
Art as expression - Surely the artist couldn&#39;t have been experiencing the same emotion that I&#39;m experiencing as I look on these. I wouldn&#39;t wish that on any human being.</description>

      <title>Not So Precious Moments</title>

      <description>Yesterday, I received an anonymous package by campus mail that contained this. I assume it was sent by a student in my Aesthetics class. It&#39;s a good example of an adequacy condition for an aesthetic theory â€” any theory that claims that this is good art must be rejected.
What should I do to get even? Maybe we&#39;ll have to reinstate those daily presentations.</description>

      <title>Triumph of the Will</title>
      <link>http://randyridenour.net/2009/08/28/triumph-of-the-will/</link>

      <description>Triumph of the Will, directed by Leni Riefenstahl, is the film that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember in Aesthetics this morning. Roger Ebert, in his 1994 review of a documentary about Riefenstahl asks exactly the right question:
 &amp;ldquo;These are by general consent two of the best documentaries ever made. But because they reflect the ideology of a monstrous movement, they pose a classic question of the contest between art and morality: Is there such a thing as pure art, or does all art make a political statement?</description>
