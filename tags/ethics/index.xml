      <title>Abandoning Jubilee — The Structural Causes of Poverty</title>
      <link>http://randyridenour.net/project/jubilee-poverty/</link>

      <description>The Jubilee law of Leviticus 25 is a radical economic plan which requires a leveling of real assets every fifty years, thus providing an economic structure that regularly dissolves large economic inequalities. It is impossible to follow the letter of the Jubilee law in a modern non-agrarian economy, but this should not free us from the responsibility of adhering to the spirit of the law. A survey of social structures in the United States reveals an economy that is contrary to the spirit of Jubilee, one that not only makes inequalities possible, but makes escaping from poverty nearly impossible.</description>

      <title>Should the Church Bear the Welfare Burden?</title>

      <description>I should have rather asked if the church alone should bear the burden of providing welfare. There is no doubt that the church, myself included, should bear more of the burden of caring for the poor, for that is just one of the many sacrificial things Jesus calls us to do. The church, though, cannot bear the welfare burden as it is today. Ron Sider, in Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America, estimates that shouldering just the cost of Medicaid would cost each Christian congregation approximately one-half million dollars per year.</description>

      <title>Indifference</title>

      <description>I passed a church this morning that had this statement on the sign: &amp;ldquo;Indifference Not Hate.&amp;rdquo; I’m curious what is meant by this, is it supposed to be a statement of reassurance to the community? &amp;ldquo;It’s not that we hate you, we really just don’t care.&amp;rdquo; Would you rather be hated or simply ignored? At least hate is an acknowledgment of the existence and importance of the other person.</description>

      <description>I wrote this eight years ago, after President Obama&amp;rsquo;s election:
 The year that I was born, 1963, was marked by these significant events:
 In April, Martin Luther King was arrested and jailed in Birmingham. In May, “Bull” Connor, the Commissioner of Public Safety in Birmingham used police dogs and fire hoses on a demonstration in Birmingham. In June, Medgar Evers, the NAACP Field Secretary for Mississippi, was murdered outside his home.</description>

      <title>Guns, Cakes, and Gay Weddings</title>

      <description>Internet memes rarely constitute a high level of discourse, but they can sometimes prompt interesting conversations. This morning, a friend posted one that read,
 If selling a gay couple a wedding cake means a &amp;ldquo;christian&amp;rdquo; baker participated in their marriage, does selling a gun to a murderer mean a &amp;ldquo;christian&amp;rdquo; gun store owner participated in the murder?
 The gun store owner does indeed participate in the murder, though not in a way that makes him1 morally responsible for the murder.</description>

      <title>Relativism and the Rights of Women in Afghanistan</title>

      <description>Cultural Relativism For many of those that hold the position, cultural relativism is motivated by a belief that we should be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Most of the time, this is expressed in a way that is simply inconsistent, that is, given that there are no objective, universal moral truths, we ought to be tolerant of the moral beliefs of other cultures. Unfortunately, one cannot consistently assert both that there are no objective, universal, moral truths and that we have a moral obligation to be tolerant, especially since our culture is often intolerant.</description>

      <description>Saturday afternoon, protestors lined the bridge at Rogers Avenue and Interstate 44 in Lawton, Oklahoma. They held signs demanding that the children currently detained for illegal immigration be sent back to their home countries.
National Public Radio recently reported on another protest:
 This week outside the southern Arizona town of Oracle, Marla and Bruce Bemis — along with several dozen of their neighbors — were lined up along a road waving American flags and holding signs, as patriotic music occasionally played in the background.</description>

      <title>Talking About Suicide</title>

      <description>I was saddened to hear that Robin Williams died this week, apparently by suicide. I was also saddened to read how some people in faith communities reacted to the news. Some of these reactions struck me as callous, demonstrably false, or, at best, simply irrelevant.
Over the past thirty years, I have known three soldiers who committed suicide, During my two deployments, I have been involved in more suicide interventions than I care to remember, and I regularly teach suicide prevention classes to Army units.</description>

      <description>The ethical and moral issues that face people in the U.S. have a great deal to do with how we see the world, whether we see it as interconnected or not, our responsibility for our neighbors nearby and far away, how we&#39;re going to use the resources and the gifts we have to the benefit of somebody beyond our own selves Episcopal Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori, Chicago Tribune, December 2, 2010</description>

      <title>Moral Relativism</title>

      <guid>http://randyridenour.net/2008/11/01/moral-relativism/</guid>
      <description>In Ethics, Friday, I sketched out an argument against moral relativism that appeals to the standard argument for moral relativism. The following is a typical argument for moral relativism:
There is widespread disagreement about ethical claims. There is no rational way to settle this disagreement. If there is no rational way to settle a disagreement concerning a claim, then we should deny that such claims are objectively true. Therefore, ethical claims are not objectively true.</description>

      <title>Concern for the Middle Class and Matthew 25</title>

      <description>Both presidential candidates seem to be stressing the importance of adopting policies that are good for the middle class. I have to admit that such talk resonates with me, probably because I am a member of the middle class. Today, though, I saw a title of a blog post by Adam Taylor that is making me rethink my assumptions about the priority of the middle class.
It was titled &#34;Just as You Did for the Middle Class, You Also Did for Me.</description>

      <title>World Food Summit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The summit on soaring food prices ended last week. For years, I have read that there is plenty of food available to feed everyone on the planet, but the problem was distributing that food. We know from recent events in Myanmar that uncooperative regimes can make aid distribution impossible. Now, though, it seems that there is a genuine food shortage, not simply a problem of distribution. What has changed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Millennium Development Goals</title>

      <description>Yesterday, Mitch Randall, pastor of NorthHaven Church in Norman, preached on Christianity and Justice. In his message, he discussed the Millennium Development Goals, seven goals that have been adopted by the world&#39;s countries, including the United States. It is legitimate for the church to ask what we can do to help our own nation achieve its stated goals.
The eight goals are outlined on the United Nations Website:
