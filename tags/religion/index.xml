      <description>God of Love,
When I see a stranger,
do you see a beloved child?
When I see an enemy,
do you see a friend?
May I see what is,
and not what I fear might be.
Even more,
may I see what could be,
if I were to give even a fraction
of the grace that I have received.
Amen</description>

      <title>Making Beautiful Things</title>

      <description>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s worship at NorthHaven Church was planned and led by Autumn Lockett, Josh Lockett, and Chris Canary. I was particularly struck by the words of one of the songs: &amp;ldquo;You make beautiful things out of the dust&amp;hellip; You make beautiful things out of us.&amp;rdquo;
Those words were exemplified later when the members of the congregation gathered to each put fingerprint leaves on Josh Lockett&amp;rsquo;s sketch of a tree, fingerprints from the young and the old, from those who have been in the community for years, and from those who have been there for only months.</description>

      <description>A prayer for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s sermon at Spring Creek Baptist Church:
God of life,
Sometimes our prayers are as parched as the desert
and our hearts as dry as the dunes of sand.
We take offense at things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter,
but ignore the ones that do.
When others are hungry,
we are full.
When others are hurting,
we are numb.
When others are cold,
we rest comfortably
beneath warm blankets of apathy.</description>

      <description>It is finals week here at Oklahoma Baptist University. Here is a prayer for students:
Dear students,
May God calm your anxieties,
refresh your minds,
and honor the faithfulness
you have shown this semester.
Remember that God has gifted you
more than you can imagine,
and you are capable of more
than you&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed.
May the great wisdom of the Father,
the incomparable love of the Son,
and the mighty power of the Spirit</description>

      <description>Some thoughts on President Trump&amp;rsquo;s Executive Order on &amp;ldquo;Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty&amp;rdquo; that was recently issued:
First of all, the President&amp;rsquo;s executive order doesn&amp;rsquo;t change anything about religious leaders engaging in political action from the pulpit. This is from section 2, the relevant part of the order:
 The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury.</description>

      <description>(Photograph: Weeping Mary by Martin Gommel)1 
&amp;ldquo;Who is it you are looking for?&amp;rdquo;
is a question for me,
not just for Mary.
Mary looked at Jesus, and saw the gardener.
I look at my
neighbor, and see a stranger;
a stranger, an see an antagonist;
an antagonist, and see an enemy.
Help me, Lord, to see you,
wherever, and whoever, you are.
Amen

      <description>Loving God,
Despair or hope?
That was the choice
on that day when
all seemed lost.
Though it may
seem foolish,
we choose hope,
and wait to see
what tomorrow brings.

      <description>(Mosaic: Carrying the Cross of Christ by Gabriel Loire)1
It is a sign
that we cannot
really understand
what it means
for God to die,
that we remember
this day when
truth and beauty
hung upon a cross
and we call it good.
What our minds cannot comprehend,
our words cannot express.
So, we can do nothing
but stand in silence
before the glory
and the horror
of the cross.</description>

      <description>This day of the church calendar, Maundy Thursday, gets its name from John 13:34, which, in the Latin Vulgate, begins with &amp;ldquo;mandatum novum&amp;rdquo; — a new commandment. After washing the feet of the disciples earlier in chapter 13, Jesus told them,
 I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.</description>

      <description>Holy God,
Examine my thoughts
on this Palm Sunday.
Does my Jesus&amp;hellip;
Want the very same things I want?
Love only the same people I love?
Hate all of the same people I hate?
Have an agenda that fits too easily into my own agenda?
Never say anything that makes me uncomfortable?
If so, then what is the object of my worship?
Is it a god of my own creation,</description>

      <description>With a kiss,
Judas gave his Lord
one last chance to be
the Messiah of Judas&amp;rsquo; dreams.
Am I no better than Judas,
when I twist the words of the Lord
and manipulate them for my own purposes?
Willing to betray the Lord,
and for what?
Not even thirty pieces of silver.
Lord, have mercy.

      <description>(Painting: Lamb by Francisco Zurbarán)1
The sounds of Passover
fill the streets with
desperate bleating
as all the animals
must be dragged
to play their
sacrificial roles.
All, that is, save one
who goes quietly
with determination,
strength, and purpose.
Lamb of God
have mercy on me.
Amen

      <description>Does my God
love only what I love,
and hate only what I hate?
If so, then who is my God?
Does my God
demand nothing of me
that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give?
If not, then what value is this grace?
Lead me away from the
altar of my convenience,
and teach me once again
what it means to love you.

      <title>Usury in Oklahoma</title>

      <description>Yesterday, the House of Representatives of the State of Oklahoma passed HB 1913, a bill giving lenders the ability to charge an Annual Percentage Rate of 205.92% on a $1,500 loan.1
This bill is inconsistent with historical Christian values and should be opposed by conservatives and progressives alike. The practice of taking interest on loans is expressly forbidden in several passages of Scripture:
 Exodus 22:25-27 Leviticus 25:35-38 Deuteronomy 23:19-20; 24:6 Psalm 15:5 Ezekiel 18:7-8; 22:12 Nehemiah 5:6-132  Before 1500, every Christian writer who discussed the practice expressly condemned the practice of charging interest.</description>

      <description>For I believe the crisis in the U.S. church has almost nothing to do with being liberal or conservative; it has everything to do with giving up on the faith and discipline of our Christian baptism and settling for a common, generic U.S. identity that is part patriotism, part consumerism, part violence, and part affluence. {:.big}

      <description>Holy God,
Shall this year be like the past,
giving up that which brings joy,
so that my self-imposed poverty may be
a sign of spiritual superiority?
Instead, Lord,
by your grace,
may I give up
bitterness, arrogance,
animosity, and the
unwarranted certainty
that keeps me from
loving my neighbor.
Cover me with your ashes,
and raise me again
to walk anew
in your kingdom.
Amen</description>

      <description>Thinking a lot about the power of language this week. Here&amp;rsquo;s my prayer for the week:
In arrogant blindness,
I fail to see that
what does not offend me
may still be offensive
to those around me.
Our words are keys,
with the power to
both lock and unlock.
They can open doors
to future conversations
or close them forever.
They can be vehicles of grace
or weapons of hate and destruction.</description>

      <description>Am I so wise
that I have nothing
left to learn,
or just afraid of
what I might hear?
Though others cannot,
the voice of God still speaks,
warning that justice comes,
both for me
and for those
I have silenced.

      <description>Lord, hear my prayer.
For saying that something needs to be done
while refusing to do anything myself,
Lord, have mercy.
For believing that cries of outrage
were the same as acts of love,
Lord, have mercy.
For letting my own ego keep me from
reaching out to those with whom I disagree.
Lord, have mercy.
For pretending that loving humanity
was the same as loving my neighbor,
Lord, have mercy.</description>

that we are not
like the ones
who fight
with violence
and bloodshed.
Instead, we fight
with words and images,
tweets and memes,
dollars and budgets.
The weapons are different,
but the pain is just as real.
Lord,
If we are to fight,
may we fight for something
worth fighting for,
Not our ideologies,
nor our egos,
But for what is right,
and for those who have no voice.</description>

      <description>Gracious God,
We live in a time of change,
sometimes inspiring and exciting,
sometimes distressing and frightening,
but always challenging.
Yet even in the midst of upheaval,
we can be sure of this:
The Father still loves us,
the Son still calls us,
The Spirit still leads us,
and we must still follow –
Together,
one body,
one faith.

      <description>Holy God,
The greatest tragedy
is not to hate God,
for the one who hates
has God ever present
before his mind.
It is ambivalence,
thoughtless and uncaring,
a life that is at once
both full and empty,
full of trivialities,
yet empty of meaning
Heal my lukewarm heart, Lord,
and restore me to my first love.

I&amp;rsquo;m usually in favor of building walls, but not when it just becomes another way to burn bridges.
Prayer Almighty God,
I give thanks for those who are here today to help build this house, for those who have already worked to bring us to this point, and for those who will be here in the future.</description>

Am I Mary, saying yes when others would jeer?

      <description>Peace be with you,
When a new emperor took the throne in Rome, messengers were sent to the rich and powerful to deliver &amp;ldquo;glad tidings&amp;rdquo; of Caesar, who was called &amp;ldquo;savior and lord&amp;rdquo; and promised to bring peace to the empire through the power of his vast riches and his mighty armies.
But when the King was born in Bethlehem, messengers from God were sent, not to the rich and powerful, but to those too poor to be noticed by the empire.</description>

      <description>Father of Light,
The creator of the universe
came to us as a helpless child,
reminding us that there is no
reconciliation without risk
or love without a chance of loss.
But we sacrificed peace
on the altar of security,
preferring to remain in darkness
than to venture out into the light,
desiring our kingdom more than yours.
Give us the courage
to drop our guard,
and open our lives</description>

      <description>The Gospel text for the third Sunday of Advent in year A is Matthew 11:2-11, which, on the surface, seems like an odd choice for the Christmas season, especially for a day known as the &amp;ldquo;Sunday of joy.&amp;rdquo; It opens with what is apparently some doubt on the part of John the Baptist: &amp;ldquo;When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, &amp;lsquo;Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?</description>

      <description>Love left its throne,
to join us in our
weakness and frailty,
divine majesty
in a helpless babe,
To walk,
and laugh,
and cry
with us,
To show us what love
was willing to risk
for our sake.
And no matter
how much we tried,
even we could not
destroy its power.
Today, may love again
walk with my feet and
speak through my mouth.
Amen</description>

      <description>God of Hope,
Advent begins with
a single, small flame
on a solitary candle,
a gentle promise
that We are not alone.
Here is our hope,
the darkness will pass,
for the light is coming.

      <description>This prayer is from 2014, but somehow seems fitting again this year:
Gracious God,
In the events of this year,
we see how fragile our lives truly are.
Daily, we are faced with a choice
to be people who live in cynicism and despair,
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.
On this day, we choose gratitude over despair,
and lift our hearts in thanksgiving to you,
the one who is the source of all good things.</description>

What are these hands?
Just the hands of one
who would once again
crucify the Christ.

      <description>There are circumstances during which my failure becomes clearly evident, and the events of the past few days have given me needed opportunity to reflect on that failure.
God&amp;rsquo;s commandment is to love — a commandment given not to an abstract entity such as government or the church, but a commandment given to me.
Even more, God commanded me to love my neighbor — not the world or humanity, but my neighbor, the one who weeps in fear and pain, the one who offends me, the one with whom I disagree, and the one of whom I take no notice.</description>

      <description>Prayer for All Saints Day
Lord,
We search for heroes
among the rich, powerful,
strong and proud —
those who look more
like the crucifiers
than the crucified.
But on this day,
we give thanks
for those for whom
loving is more important
than being loved,
and faithfulness more
dear than fame.
Not our idols,
instead, your saints.

      <description>A prayer for the days preceding the election:
God of comfort,
No matter the result,
Half of us will find
That the thing we fear
Will have come true.
Calm our fears,
And restore our faith.
Cleanse our despair,
And give us hope.
Banish our anger,
And renew our love.
Remind us once again
That the Spirit who unites us
Is greater than anything
That could ever divide us.

      <description>God of Grace,

He chose silence.
May I guard against

an image of Jesus to use

Thy will, not my own, Lord.

If such a slender trunk

into your sustaining love,
our branches reach out
to shelter those in need,
then reach up to the heavens
to bid your Kingdom come,

      <description>Creator God,
I gaze out from my fortress,
and see a dangerous, hostile place,
with dangers on all sides,
forcing me to defend my territory
against my many enemies.
Sometimes, I see a cold, unfeeling place,
that demands that I care only for myself,
since no one else will care for me.
Tell me what I would see, Lord,
if only I could replace these
grimy panes of doubt and fear,</description>

In past years, I&amp;rsquo;ve generally thought about the cost to military families, compared to a country that mostly feels inconvenienced at the airport. This year, I thought instead about the wonderful friends I made during two deployments. Although I do wish that the conflict had never happened, those friends are gifts from God that I will always cherish.</description>

      <description>Thank you for the gift of friends,
those who are near,
and those who are far;
those still with us,
and those who await us
in the life to come.
Kind words remind us
that there is no distance,
neither time, nor space,
neither this life, nor the next,
that cannot be crossed.
For nothing can separate us
from the love of God,
and by that same love,
we are connected to each other.</description>

for an enemy truly loved
is but a friend to be.

be enough, until that day
that we know fully,

      <description>I should have rather asked if the church alone should bear the burden of providing welfare. There is no doubt that the church, myself included, should bear more of the burden of caring for the poor, for that is just one of the many sacrificial things Jesus calls us to do. The church, though, cannot bear the welfare burden as it is today. Ron Sider, in Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America, estimates that shouldering just the cost of Medicaid would cost each Christian congregation approximately one-half million dollars per year.</description>

sat in silence with those in pain,

until we are left with nothing
but bloodshot eyes and numb hearts.

      <description>Lord Jesus,
On this day that we mourn
the loss of so many whom you love,
it is tempting to pray
that you would return
and take us from this world.
Tempting, because it shifts
the burden to you,
leaving nothing for us
but escape, evasion, and excuse.
Yet you are not the God who excuses,
but the God who redeems;
not the God of escape,
but the God of the cross.</description>

      <description>Gracious God,
Thank you for the precious people
who, quietly and humbly, have
been the hands and feet of Jesus for us,
who have celebrated our joys,
wept in our sorrows,
and sacrificed to help us
become everything you
have created us to be;
each one a gift of love
from your gracious hand.
May we also be a gift to others,
who need to see your grace, especially
the many women around the world</description>

      <description>Almighty God,
Free us from the prisons
that we have built
with the bricks of
our own expectations,
trapped in cells
with invisible walls
that confine us only
because we let them.
Deliver us from the temptation
to trap others by presuming
to know your will for them,
and forgive us for the arrogance
of thinking that we could ever
constrain you with limits
on what you can do,
who you can save,</description>

      <description>Father,
We live in a world
with walls both
visible and invisible;
some protect us from harm,
and others protect
us from inconvenience,
hearing only the voices
that reinforce our fears.
Open a window in the walls,
so that we may hear the voice
of the one who needs to be heard,
who speaks in a still, small voice
so often drowned out by our noisy lives.
Amen</description>

      <description>Gracious God,
We live in fear
of failure and
disappointment,
afraid that we
might say or do
the wrong thing.
Paralyzed by risk,
we simply do nothing
and remain silent.
But who am I,
blind as I am,
to judge what does
or does not fail?
Help me to trust in you,
the one who makes all things
work together for good,
for, to, and through
those who love you.</description>

      <description>Thank you, Lord,
for showing us that
the Gospel still speaks,
that the Spirit still calls,
and that people still respond,
Today, it is one who,
by the act of baptism,
calls us to recover
the excitement and hope
of our first calling.
As her faith grows,
so may ours also.
We can only dream of what
you have in store for her,
may the Church have the wisdom
to at least not get in the way.</description>

You warned the disciples
to be wary of claims
that the messiah had come.
You said, &amp;ldquo;When told
he is in the inner rooms,
do not believe it.&amp;rdquo;
When Thomas was told
that you appeared
in the inner rooms,
he heeded your word
and did not believe it
until he saw for himself.
And of those who claim
to have special insight
of your will for us,
may we be like Thomas,</description>

      <description>Gracious Father,
Holy Saturday,
the day of waiting,
after all of our
hopes and dreams
have been crushed
by a cruel world
and a naive idealism
is forced to succumb
to a harsher reality.
But even after the
horrors of Friday,
the morning sun still
rose on Saturday.
And we have hope,
however faint,
however absurd.
So we wait,
wait to see
what Sunday
will bring.

Examine my heart,
show me my deepest desire.
Is it to be great,
safe,
secure,
invincible,
and strong?
Or is it to follow Jesus?
To build my protective fortress,
or to risk loving my neighbor?
To demand my rights,
or to take up the cross?
Not my will, but yours be done.

dreams of defeated enemies,

Instead of palms,

grander symbols

Give us a new vision
of a world where
there are no enemies
to vanquish and
no wars to fight.

a path that so many seem to be walking.
It is an easy path
that calls us to
give in to our temptations
to hate, despise, and fear,
to become something less
than what you have created us to be.
You have called us to a higher path,
to renounce fear,
and proclaim faith,
to cast off hatred,</description>

      <description>The text for Mitch Randall&amp;rsquo;s sermon was the story of Simon the magician in Acts 8. As I though about the passage, I was struck by Simon&amp;rsquo;s willingness to pay for the power to confer the Holy Spirit on others, that is, his desire to exchange financial power for religious power. That, in turn, prompted me to think about the current role of religion in politics.

      <description>God of life,
Sometimes our prayers are as parched as the desert
and our hearts as dry as the dunes of sand.
We take offense at things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter,
but ignore the ones that do.
When others are hungry,
we are full.
When others are hurting,
we are numb.
When others are cold,
we rest comfortably
beneath warm blankets of apathy.
But even in our self-righteousness,
we still feel something,</description>

Father,
The dying tree,
desperate to stay alive,
tries to maintain
the illusion of being
healthy and full,
but it cannot
hide the truth,
for it saps life from
everything around it.
Forgive me,
for I take much
more than I give,
and like the tree,
never truly live.
May these roots
once again taste
the goodness of
your grace, and

We come trembling,
knowing that hearts
that are hard

We come with hope,
knowing that what

Do we give as a a means of exercising power?</description>

      <description>For the First Sunday of Advent
God of all hope,
When those seeking food and shelter
are told only to pray to Jesus,
When those fleeing the devastation of war
are told only to go to Jesus,
And when those who
have lost all hope
are told only to hope in Jesus,
Then, Lord, I have failed.
For if I will not welcome
those whom the world now rejects,
then why would I welcome the child</description>

      <description>Gracious Father,
There are those today
who struggle to give thanks
because of loss,
illness,
separation,
or grief.
May their spirits
be comforted with
the knowledge that
our thoughts and prayers
are with them today.

      <description>Father,
I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by voices
telling me what I want to hear,
voices urging me to seek my own good,
to protect what is mine,
that my security is more important
than the needs of others.
Help me, Lord,
to hear a different message,
one that challenges me
to become something
better than I have been,
and to dismantle my own petty kingdom
for the sake of the Kingdom of God.</description>

      <description>As we mourn for the lives lost this week in Paris, Lord, hear our prayer.
Almighty God,
We grieve this week,
crying with those who suffer,
lamenting with those who mourn.
Even in our anger,
May we always seek justice,
and never revenge;
healing, not harm;
and a measured response,
instead of thoughtless reaction.
When circumstances tempt us
to sink into the depths of despair,
may we hear the prophet&amp;rsquo;s voice,</description>

You invite us

burdens, cares, concerns,
fears, and anxieties,
and give them all to you.
Then, wrapped in the
sweet warmth of your grace,
we can dance in joy
before the throne,
as beloved children
of the Father
who have finally
found their way home.

We search for heroes
among the rich, powerful,
strong and proud —
those who look more
like the crucifiers
than the crucified.
But on this day,
we give thanks
for those for whom
loving is more important
than being loved,
and faithfulness more
dear than fame.
Not our idols, Lord,
instead, your saints.

      <description>God of grace,
On the door of the church,
Luther proclaimed his message,
&amp;ldquo;The true treasure of the church
is the most holy gospel
of the glory and grace of God.&amp;rdquo;
A treasure too great
to be kept to ourselves,
yet why is that
we who have received
so much grace somehow
seem to have so little
left to offer?
Forgive me, Lord,
and let me never again
confuse your river of grace</description>

When our spirits are broken,

Forgive us for those times
When individuality was more
important to us than community&amp;hellip;
When being right was more
important to us than being loving&amp;hellip;
When our own agendas were more
important to us than your Kingdom&amp;hellip;
When our own labels were more
important to us than the name of Christ.
Give us now a new vision
of that which binds us together,
The same baptism,
in response to the same call,</description>

      <description>Grieving for the lives lost in Oregon, a
prayer for World Communion Sunday, 2015:
Merciful God,
At least three while
we sit in worship,
Eighty today,
as we rest
on the Sabbath,
Thirty thousand lives
lost in a single year.
Some were taken
by their own hand,
some by accident,
still others by strangers.
All were lost in
brutal acts of violence,
sacrificed on the altar
of our rights.

      <description>A prayer for those searching for the perfect church:
Lord Jesus,
We move from
church to church,
searching for one
that meets our needs,
one that is perfect
for people like us.
But what do we hope to find?
A church filled
with perfect people?
People who have no faults,
who speak no unkind words,
who never hurt one another,
and never have regrets?
A perfect church, indeed,
but a church with no place</description>

      <description>Gracious God, Giver of life,
Long ago,
a tree was planted by your grace
and watered by your providential care.
It was robbed of
life and beauty,
and used to fashion a cross
to bear body of the Christ,
broken for our redemption.
And so, Lord, like that tree,
we have been planted,
watered, and have grown,
yet the time has come for us
to offer our lives to you,</description>

The sound of heartbreak
rang through the garden
as the Lord went out
in the cool of the evening
to meet his children,
who hid in the place
that he gave them,
a place made for
fellowship with God.
God still calls,
and we still hide,
in places built for
communion with him,
masking our shame and fear
by doing the good while
failing to hear his call</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t find the original source of this blessing, but it&amp;rsquo;s attributed to the Franciscans. It&amp;rsquo;s both powerful and provocative to think of discomfort, anger, tears, and foolishness as blessings.
 May God bless you with discomfort,
At easy answers, half-truths,
And superficial relationships
So that you may live
Deep within your heart.
May God bless you with anger
At injustice, oppression,
And exploitation of people,
So that you may work for</description>

thoughts of things that were

But one eye to the past,

thanking you for life,
while refusing to live it.
May I never forget
that the Lord of the past and future
is also Lord in the meantime.

You have given all to me.
To you, Lord, I return it.
Everything is yours; do with it what you will.

Help me to see this day for what it is,
a gift, although expected,
one that was surely not owed,
an act of immeasurable grace.

      <description>Mike Bumgarner quoted part of this passage in a sermon this morning. It is worth reflecting on:
 This is where a tremendous decision takes place: whether we Christians have enough strength to witness before the world that we are not dreamers with our heads in the clouds&amp;hellip; that our faith really is not opium that keeps us content within an unjust world. Instead, and precisely because our minds are set on things above, we are that much more stubborn and purposeful in protesting here on earth&amp;hellip; Does it have to be that Christianity, which began as immensely revolutionary, now has to remain conservative for all time?</description>

Father,
Protect us from the arrogance
of unwarranted certainty,
as it keeps us from hearing
the voice of our neighbor.
Cleanse us from the vanity
of inflated self-importance,
as it moves us to see only ourselves.</description>

      <description>Internet memes rarely constitute a high level of discourse, but they can sometimes prompt interesting conversations. This morning, a friend posted one that read,
 If selling a gay couple a wedding cake means a &amp;ldquo;christian&amp;rdquo; baker participated in their marriage, does selling a gun to a murderer mean a &amp;ldquo;christian&amp;rdquo; gun store owner participated in the murder?
 The gun store owner does indeed participate in the murder, though not in a way that makes him1 morally responsible for the murder.</description>

      <description>God of love and grace,
Before there was anything else,
there was love,
perfect and pure.
It was a love so full
that it manifested itself
in the creation of the infinite universe
in all of its beauty and diversity.
We rejoice today with those
who shed tears of joy
when, against all odds,
love won.
Our joy, though, is not yet complete,
as we grieve today with those
who shed tears of sorrow</description>

      <description>A reflection on the lives lost this week in Charleston, and the responsibility that we bear, either explicitly or implicitly:
God of justice,
We are told that heaven rejoices
over what has been found,
does heaven also weep for
what has been lost?
For the one whose heart
was lost in hatred,
and whose mind was
filled with empty lies?
For the nine lives that
were taken in an act</description>

      <description>Etgar Keret&amp;rsquo;s new book, The Seven Good Years is a collection of essays concerning the interval between the birth of his son and the death of his father. I was particularly intrigued by this statement from the story on NPR:
 I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at feeling sorry for myself, [but] &amp;hellip; the fact that he survived the Holocaust always kind of seemed to him that something good had happened to him in life.</description>

      <description>Great God of beauty and wonder,
There are days when I wish
that you had given us
a blueprint for life,
with every step
mapped out in detail,
and every decision
already made.
Instead, you gave us
each a life for a canvas,
and gifts and talents
for a palette and brushes,
the Spirit for our guide,
and the Son for our model,
then you sent us out
into the world to paint.</description>

      <description>Gracious God,
who knows us better
than we know ourselves,
Forgive me,
when I quickly judge
a harsh word,
or impolite response
without knowing
the full story.
Everyone has a story,
and every encounter
affects the plot,
and each moment
is another opportunity
to transform the tale
from hopeless tragedy
to divine beauty.

In those times
that we feel alone,
lost in the crowd,
and disconnected
from those around us,
we take comfort in knowing
that at the center of reality
is an unending community of love,
and that we, your children,
have been invited into
the eternal fellowship
that is the
Father,
Son,
and Holy Spirit,
three persons,
but one God,
forever and ever.

      <description>God of Grace and Wholeness,
All around us, we see pain and heartache,
the effects of fragmented and broken systems,
communities, and families.
When the pain of others becomes
too much for us to bear,
we respond by building up walls
that separate us from the world.
So here we stay,
safe and secure
behind our walls of division,
seeing only ourselves,
our own problems,
and our own hopes.
We boast of our love for humanity,</description>

      <description>Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day can be an awkward time in the life of the church. There is a great deal of internal pressure to commemorate the day, but we should acknowledge that there are many who are understandably uncomfortable on this day. There are those who may have painful memories of abuse at the hand of their biological mothers, others who may have never known their mothers, and many others who have never had, nor will ever have, children of their own.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s prayer is simple, but informed by events of the week that profoundly impacted me. First, NorthHaven Church​ was in the area that sustained some wind damage in Wednesday night&amp;rsquo;s storm. The next day, Imam Imad Enchassi​ of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City graciously asked if we needed any help. To all our Muslim friends, As-Salaam-Alaikum.
Second, I see in my students a level of spiritual depth that I certainly did not have in my 20&amp;rsquo;s and may not yet have in my 50&amp;rsquo;s — one that moves beyond the superficial trivialities that pass for spirituality in much of American religion, but instead shows a deep understanding of the message of Jesus.</description>

      <description>A cry for justice swells up
from a people who have seen
so little of it.
&amp;ldquo;Yes, justice,&amp;rdquo;
comes the reply,
&amp;ldquo;But first,
we must have peace.
Peace today,
maybe justice tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;
But a peace without justice,
is not the Shalom of God.
It is a peace that serves
the status quo,
the interests of the powerful,
and the coffers of the wealthy.
The prophets tell us that
your justice is measured</description>

      <description>Holy God,
There are times when
we just have no words,
times of great beauty,
or times of great suffering.
But our silence
makes us uncomfortable,
and we feel that
we must say something,
so we fill the silence
with meaningless noise
and empty chatter.
So, when we feel the urge
to trivialize the sublime
with our vain babbling,
give us the strength
to cover our mouths
and stand before</description>

      <description>This past weekend was a weekend of funerals — two very different people, both with lives that had been cut tragically short. Then, on Tuesday, I learned of two more tragedies involving families in the Army units that I serve. Coincidentally, all of this happens as one of my classes is studying one of the central works on the problem of suffering, the chapter titled in &amp;ldquo;Rebellion&amp;rdquo; in Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece, The Brothers Karamazov.</description>

      <description>Believing in the resurrection does not just mean assenting to a dogma and noting a historical fact. It means participating in this creative act of God. Resurrection is not a consoling opium, soothing us with the promise of a better world in the hereafter. It is the energy for a rebirth of this life. The hope doesn’t point to another world. It is focused on the redemption of this one. Jürgen Moltmann</description>

      <description>Tiny gold crosses
hang from sparkling
gold chains,
signs of
wealth, affluence,
and good taste,
compared to
a large wooden cross
covered in blood,
an instrument of torture,
a symbol designed
to bring terror
to enemies of the state.
On this day, Lord,
give me a vision
of the horror of the cross,
for without it
there is no beauty
of the cross.

Instead, we are to be known

Love,

entangled,
accepting,

the people celebrated
their new freedom
from their Greek overlords.
And in a new century,
and under a new empire,
the people once again
wave the palm branches
and cheer for a new hero.
Jesus rode into Jerusalem
and the people cheered,
but Jesus wept,
for they could not see
that the Jesus for whom we cheer
is not the same Jesus
that we behold upon the cross</description>

      <description>It is telling that the cry from the cross, &amp;ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&amp;rdquo; is followed by the simple declaration, &amp;ldquo;I thirst.&amp;rdquo; We thirst for God, not because God has forsaken us, nor because we have forsaken God. We simply thirst for God — we thirst for God&amp;rsquo;s mercy, we thirst for God&amp;rsquo;s justice in this world, we thirst to be loved by God&amp;rsquo;s people as God loves us.</description>

      <description>So far, this has been the most challenging and difficult chapter for me. Hauerwas challenges us reflect on our standard interpretations of Jesus&amp;rsquo; cry of despair from the cross, &amp;ldquo;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&amp;rdquo; and understand it not in terms of one who is sacrificed to satisfy a vengeful God, but as a cry from the God who both sacrifices and is sacrificed. That we find this cry of Jesus so difficult to comprehend shows that we, as citizens of this world, understand and identify with the power and authority of the empire.</description>

      <description>Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s Fear and Trembling focuses on Abraham, an example of what Kierkegaard calls a &amp;ldquo;Knight of Faith.&amp;rdquo; When I asked for other examples, someone suggested Mary, the mother of Jesus. At the time, I was skeptical, because it did not seem to me that Mary had an opportunity to reject God&amp;rsquo;s plan; the angel Mary announced that Mary would conceive, and never asked Mary if she wanted to cooperate in this endeavor.</description>

God of love,
We open our arms
to hug and to hold,
welcome and invite.
With outstretched hands,
we lower our defenses
and accept the vulnerability
that comes with love.
Did the soldiers know
what they were doing
as they stretched the arms
of Jesus onto the cross?
Humiliated and scorned,
the Eternal King
chose vulnerability, love,
and reconciliation
instead of rejection.

The chapter opened with a discussion of the reticence of the Gospels, why do they not tell us everything that we want to know? Why is Jesus simply silent on what many of us think are the most important questions of the day?</description>

      <description>I see a man
sleeping on a bench
in the cold,
And I say,
&amp;ldquo;Thank you, Lord,
for I am not like him.&amp;rdquo;
I see a woman
alone, in tears,
mourning,
And I say,
&amp;ldquo;Thank you, Lord,
for I am not like her.&amp;rdquo;
I see a man
upon a cross,
humiliated, scorned,
despised,
And suddenly my
foolish pride is clear
even to me,
And I cry,
&amp;ldquo;Forgive me, Lord,
for I am not like you.</description>

      <description>Lord Jesus,
As I find myself
grasping for more,
even though I
surely have enough,
I hear the voice
of the Spirit whisper,
&amp;ldquo;Is this how you
follow the one
who had no place
to lay his head,
whose only robe
was taken from him
and gambled away?&amp;rdquo;
May I never confuse
the abundant life
with an empty
life of abundance.
Amen</description>

      <description>Reflections on Cross-Shattered Christ: Meditations on the Seven Last Words by Stanley Hauerwas, Chapter 1.
This chapter is perfect reading for the week following Ash Wednesday. The traditional liturgical declaration uttered by the minister &amp;ldquo;Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return&amp;rdquo; is a reminder of our mortality. Ash Wednesday is quickly forgotten, though, just as the somber reflection that occurs after a funeral quickly fades as life returns to normal.</description>

      <description>Lord, have mercy,
for I have heard the gentle voice of God,
yet speak to others with words that hurt and destroy.
Lord, have mercy,
for I have been given more than I could ever use,
yet refuse to see the needs of those around me.
Lord, have mercy,
for you have placed me in positions of power and influence,
yet I use those positions for my own gain, and not in service to your children.</description>

      <description>Father,
In the blindness of our arrogance,
we think that we are free,
yet, so often, we are in chains,
slaves to the satisfaction of our own desires,
and to the pursuit of our own selfish ends.
Our prayer today is that
we may be transformed,
freed, so that we may
live as Christ lived,
and love as he loved,
every moment of our lives
an act of restoration and redemption,</description>

 I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them — thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful&amp;hellip; I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accusel I do not even want to accuse the accusers&amp;hellip; And all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!</description>

      <description>Jesus,
You found a man living in a cemetery,
bound by chains that he did not forge,
forced on him by people who were afraid.
I, too, am bound in chains,
some forged by ignorance,
every link a failure to recognize
your image in another human.
Others forged by arrogance,
of thinking that there are those
not fit for your kingdom,
or for your service.
Still others forged by fear,</description>

On this reading, the phrase means something like, &amp;ldquo;In order to impress those listening in,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;In order to sound smarter than he really was.</description>

 There is no god and that’s the simple truth. If every trace of any single religion died out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created exactly that way again. There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense. If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.</description>

      <description>For the NorthHaven Church Deacon Ordination Service
April 27, 2014
I have been asked to deliver a charge to the congregation on this occasion. A reasonable question to ask is why should the church be tasked with anything in the event of a deacon ordination? It is the new deacons that have been tasked to do something; the church is simply the recipient of those actions, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? So, what is the point of a charge to the church?</description>

      <description>God of grace,
We live in a word of concrete barricades, wooden fences, and stone walls that we have built to protect, separate, control, and hide; some hastily thrown up in hours, others carefully built in weeks or months.
Other walls, though, are constructed over a lifetime, and are just as real and just as effective—downcast eyes, hostile stares, and stony silence—walls constructed to prevent the pain of rejection, or to keep others out of our comfortable lives.</description>

      <description>Social media was certainly inundated with reactions to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Supreme Court ruling in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby. The majority were at the two extremes&amp;mdash;either this was a great victory for religious liberty and a stunning blow to the Obama administration, or it was an unprecedented power-grab by religious conservatives and wealthy corporate America that will only prevent women from getting the health care that they need.
As is generally the case, neither extreme position is correct.</description>

      <description>Mitch Randall always seems to have some clever and interesting themes to use for his sermon series. In the past, we&amp;rsquo;ve had, among others, movies, board-games, and monsters. This summer, the series was called &amp;ldquo;NorthHaven Goes to Broadway.&amp;rdquo; Unfortunately, I missed most of it because of our vacation trip and military duty, but I was there this past Sunday for his sermon based on Les Mis&amp;eacute;rables.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if she was doing it to spiritually prepare for Sunday, but Sheri, my wife, had been playing the 2012 film version over the past week.</description>

      <description>Saturday afternoon, protestors lined the bridge at Rogers Avenue and Interstate 44 in Lawton, Oklahoma. They held signs demanding that the children currently detained for illegal immigration be sent back to their home countries.
National Public Radio recently reported on another protest:
 This week outside the southern Arizona town of Oracle, Marla and Bruce Bemis — along with several dozen of their neighbors — were lined up along a road waving American flags and holding signs, as patriotic music occasionally played in the background.</description>

Stay with me
for a moment
while I divide
up my life.
I&amp;rsquo;ll give you Sunday,
but I&amp;rsquo;m keeping
Monday through Saturday.
I&amp;rsquo;ll give you ten percent,
so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t
ask what I do with
the other ninety.
I&amp;rsquo;ll do whatever you ask,
just don&amp;rsquo;t make any
unreasonable demands.
Then, in the stillness,
I hear a quiet voice

frozen into place.
They wore expressions,

We call our masks
by different names:
Facebook,
Twitter,
Social media;
still used to
project an image,
one that even we ourselves
can eventually come to believe.

Bill Leonard, professor of church history at Wake Forest, recently posted an article at Associated Baptist Press reviewing past mistaken predictions. Note the final two paragraphs:
 For now, let’s keep last things last. The end will come, for individuals and ultimately for the entire enterprise, but perhaps the answers lie, not in escapist theories, but with dying whales, vanishing forests, polluted water and rising ozone, “the fire next time.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, the story goes, a preacher ran through the streets of the city shouting, &#39;We must put God into our lives. We must put God into our lives.&#39; And hearing him, the old monastic rose up in the city plaza to say, &#39;No, sir, you are wrong. You see, God is already in our lives. Our task is simply to recognize that.&#39; Joan Chittister</description>

      <description>A life in prayer is a life in open hands where you are not ashamed of your weakness but realize that it is more perfect for you to be led by the other than to seek to hold everything in your own hand. Henri Nouwen</description>

 Be seen reading the grittier classics of Christian literature. Though Blue Like Jazz is an almost irresistible first choice, try for something more subtle, like Flannery O’Connor, J.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been following the debate over the proposed Mosque near the site of the World Trade Center in New York City. Baptists have historically been champions of religious liberty, and denying Muslims the right to build a house of worship is contrary to historic Baptist principles.
The question to ask is this - would you be happy with a Christian Church at the same location? If so, then do not deny Muslim-Americans the same rights that you are willing to give Christian-Americans.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m fed up with your conferences and conventions.
I want nothing to do with your religion projects,
your pretentious slogans and goals.
I&amp;rsquo;m sick of your fund-raising schemes,
your public relations and image making.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had all I can take of your noisy ego-music.
When was the last time you sang to me?
Do you know what I want?
I want justice—oceans of it.</description>

      <description>There is, in a word, nothing comfortable about the Bible &amp;ndash; until we manage to get so used to it that we make it comfortable for ourselves. But then we are perhaps too used to it and too at home in it. Let us not be too sure we know the Bible &amp;hellip; just because we have learned not to have problems with it. Have we perhaps learned &amp;hellip; not to really pay attention to it?</description>

      <description>Every February, Oklahoma Baptist University celebrates Founders&#39; Day with a special chapel service. This year&#39;s service was particularly special, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the school&#39;s founding. The service included a reenactment of W.P. Blake and G. Lee Phelps kneeling in prayer on the site in Shawnee, Oklahoma that was to become Oklahoma Baptist University. To be honest, I can now remember only a single sentence from either prayer, but it is a sentence that I don&#39;t think I will ever forget: &#34;</description>

      <description>Recently, I posted a quote on the Tumblr page from Jaroslav Pelikan: &#34;The only alternative to tradition is bad tradition.&#34; At the time, I realized it needed some explanation, but posted it anyway. Some comments show that the quote is meaningless without some context.
John Mouracade pointed out that it looks like a false dilemma. A false dilemma is a fallacy committed when one asserts that at least one of two different alternatives must be true, but ignores other alternatives that might also be true.</description>

At least hate is an acknowledgment of the existence and importance of the other person.</description>

      <description>Both presidential candidates seem to be stressing the importance of adopting policies that are good for the middle class. I have to admit that such talk resonates with me, probably because I am a member of the middle class. Today, though, I saw a title of a blog post by Adam Taylor that is making me rethink my assumptions about the priority of the middle class.
It was titled &#34;Just as You Did for the Middle Class, You Also Did for Me.</description>

      <description>I am a Baptist who is committed to religious freedom, and I think that the separation of church and state is critical for maintaining religious freedom. I also believe in the value of the classical liberal tradition, in which everyone should have the freedom to choose their own values and act to achieve what they think is good, provided that it does not interfere with another&#39;s ability to do the same.</description>

In his message, he discussed the Millennium Development Goals, seven goals that have been adopted by the world&#39;s countries, including the United States. It is legitimate for the church to ask what we can do to help our own nation achieve its stated goals.
The eight goals are outlined on the United Nations Website:
