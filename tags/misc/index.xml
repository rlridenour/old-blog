      <title>Favorite Bad Amazon Review</title>

      <description>This is now my favorite 1-star book review on Amazon. It&amp;rsquo;s a review of R For Dummies, a book on the R statistics programing language:
 If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a book to explain the letter &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; to you, keep looking, this isn&amp;rsquo;t it.
 I hope that person eventually found what they needed.</description>

      <description>We left Accra, Ghana at 2300 last Saturday night. After thirty hours of traveling, we arrived in Oklahoma City. Monday night, I had to go visit my father at his hospital. Tuesday and Wednesday, I taught a Bible study on forgiveness at First Baptist Church, Sparks, OK. Thursday night, I had my three hour political philosophy class. Finally, on Friday, I came down with a stomach bug, for which I should be thankful — I went to bed and slept for eighteen hours.</description>

      <description>We met some very interesting people during our stay at the Ullikana Inn in Bar Harbor, Maine. There were two couples there that, generally with some other couples, return every year. Before dinner, everyone met for some refreshments, during which they told about their usual evening activity at the inn. Evidently, the first time that the couples had been at the inn together, they found themselves in that room making the sort of small talk that people do when they don&amp;rsquo;t really know each other.</description>

      <description>Today, we learn that 298 people were killed when Malaysian Airlines Flight 117 was shot down over Ukraine. News sources also report that Israel launched a ground operation in Gaza.
For all who live in fear, we pray.
Christ have mercy.</description>

      <title>Thanksgiving</title>

      <description>Thanksgiving should be an opportunity for reflection, not for the gluttony and sloth that has become the norm. One of my favorite Thanksgiving traditions to share the latest world hunger statistics with my Introduction to Philosophy class. I then urge the students to spend the break reading Ron Sider’s book, Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger.
This past week reminded me of how fortunate I am to be able to share my time with both students and colleagues.</description>

      <title>Bob Feller (1918-2010)</title>

      <description>Bob Feller, who pitched for the Cleveland Indians from 1936 to 1956, died Wednesday in Cleveland. In Alan Schwarz&amp;rsquo;s 2006 book, Once Upon a Game: Baseball&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Memories, he spoke of his decision to leave professional baseball after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and enlist in the United States Navy.
 A lot of folks say that had I not missed those almost four seasons to World War II — during what was probably my physical prime — I might have had 370 or even 400 wins.</description>

      <description>These are terrible pictures from Boston.com of the devastation in Haiti.
The Haitian consul-general to the UN reports that at least 100,000 are dead, possibly several times that number. See this CNN link.</description>

      <description>It’s interesting that the prominent atheist Richard Dawkins is now claiming that reading J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books is dangerous for children. I never thought I would see Richard Dawkins taking the same position as conservative Christians. </description>

      <description>The temperature in Norman just before 5 PM is 106. The high today in Baghdad was only 110. It&#39;s a brutal summer here, but evidently a fairly mild one there.</description>
