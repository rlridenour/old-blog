      <description>As the moon revolves around the earth,
and the earth around the sun,
so my life revolves around you,
my love.

      <description>My darling wife, Sheri, is watching the PBS version of Jane Austen&#39;s Northanger Abbey this evening. I have a set of wireless headphones that I call the &#34;Jane Austen Specials&#34; to wear at such times. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t make sure that they were charged this afternoon. A great mistake on my part.</description>

      <title>Costa Rica</title>

      <description>We had a wonderful week in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country filled with charming people. We had a tour of the rain forest canopy and two bus trips through the countryside. If you ever plan a trip to Costa Rica, consider avoiding the rainy season. It did rain every day while we were there, but cleared up beautifully, of course, on the day that we left.
While we were on the bus traveling to the rain forest, our guide, Oliver, gave us a lesson on the history, geography, and culture of the country.</description>

      <description>We are leaving tomorrow for a week in Costa Rica. We&#39;re all looking forward to a wonderful trip. Costa Rica should be quite a bit different than anywhere I&#39;ve been recently. I&#39;ll post some pictures when we get back.</description>
