      <description>What has given the South her identity are those beliefs and qualities which she has absorbed from the Scriptures and from her own history of defeat and violation: a distrust of the abstract, a sense of human dependence on the grace of God, and a knowledge that evil is not simply a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be endured. {:.big}

      <description>For I believe the crisis in the U.S. church has almost nothing to do with being liberal or conservative; it has everything to do with giving up on the faith and discipline of our Christian baptism and settling for a common, generic U.S. identity that is part patriotism, part consumerism, part violence, and part affluence. {:.big}

      <description>And perhaps the great day will come when a people, distinguished by wars and victories and by the highest development of a military order and intelligence, and accustomed to make the heaviest sacrifices for these things, will exclaim of its own free will, &amp;ldquo;We break the sword,&amp;rdquo; and will smash its entire military establishment down to its lowest foundations. Rendering oneself unarmed when one has been the best-armed, out of a height of feeling—that is the means to real peace, which must always rest on a peace of mind; whereas the so-called armed peace, as it now exists in all countries, is the absence of peace of mind.</description>

      <description>Mike Bumgarner quoted part of this passage in a sermon this morning. It is worth reflecting on:
 This is where a tremendous decision takes place: whether we Christians have enough strength to witness before the world that we are not dreamers with our heads in the clouds&amp;hellip; that our faith really is not opium that keeps us content within an unjust world. Instead, and precisely because our minds are set on things above, we are that much more stubborn and purposeful in protesting here on earth&amp;hellip; Does it have to be that Christianity, which began as immensely revolutionary, now has to remain conservative for all time?</description>

      <description>Thanks to AJ Lopez for sharing this quote with me.
Instead of telling our vulnerable stories, we seek safety in abstractions, speaking to each other about our opinions, ideas and beliefs rather than about our lives. Academic culture blesses this practice by insisting that the more abstract our speech, the more likely we are to touch the universal truths that unite us. But what happens is exactly the reverse: as our discourse becomes more abstract, the less connected we feel.</description>

      <description>Believing in the resurrection does not just mean assenting to a dogma and noting a historical fact. It means participating in this creative act of God. Resurrection is not a consoling opium, soothing us with the promise of a better world in the hereafter. It is the energy for a rebirth of this life. The hope doesn’t point to another world. It is focused on the redemption of this one. Jürgen Moltmann</description>

      <description>The Bible is very easy to understand. But we as Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand we are obliged to act accordingly. My God, you will say, if I do that my whole life will be ruined.

      <description>As I wrote recently, everything in existence is permanently impermanent. Patrick Rhone
 I detect shades of Heraclitus here.
Question: is this a paradox? Answer: probably not, unless Rhone is committed to the belief that nothing at all, even impermanence, is permanent. It is a good opportunity to do some analytic philosophy, though.
What is permanence? Is it a real property, or is it a derivative analyzed in terms of the real properties of an object?</description>

      <description>People have always wanted philosophers to provide digestible wisdom, yet it is as true now as it was in Plato’s time that disciplined thinking is hard. So next time you sit next to a philosopher on a plane, talk about the movie, not the meaning of life. Anthony Gottlieb</description>

      <description>Out of love of mankind, as well as despair at my embarrassing situation, seeing I had not accomplished anything and had been unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, from a genuine interest in those who make everything easy, I conceived it my task to make difficulties everywhere.

      <description>Prophetic thought for the day from Mark Woods, editor of Britain&#39;s Baptist Times, in a column for Ethics Daily.com:
&#34;The glossy lifestyle magazines which are such a feature of weekend papers are consumer pornography, designed to titillate us with longings for what most of us can never have, and those of us who can will never need.&#34;</description>

      <description>I began reading Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s Fear and Trembling yesterday. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to recall what a friend once said:
