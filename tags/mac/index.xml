      <description>My wife and I were sharing the same Apple ID, mine, for the app store, iTunes, etc. With the advent of Apple Music, I decided that a move to family sharing would be best, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think she&amp;rsquo;d fully appreciate the recommendations of playlists filled with psychedelic rock from the 60&amp;rsquo;s.
A couple of weeks later, I finally convinced my wife to start using a password manager, and having already purchased 1Password from the App Store, I decided to take advantage of family sharing.</description>

      <description>I was having some trouble with BBEdit on one of my machines, so I decided to delete and reinstall the application. That&amp;rsquo;s not very difficult in ordinary circumstances, but since I bought from the App Store, it should have been even easier. There should be no need to enter any license information, just a click and install.
First, I deleted the app. I deleted BBEdit from the applications folder. Somehow, it was still in Launchpad.</description>
