      <description>All I have is a voice To undo the folded lie, The romantic lie in the brain Of the sensual man-in-the-street And the lie of Authority Whose buildings grope the sky: There is no such thing as the State And no one exists alone; Hunger allows no choice To the citizen or the police; We must love one another or die. {:.poetry}
 Defenseless under the night

      <description>I have been browsing Jekyll themes lately, and found a very nice theme for academics, the Ed. Theme. Its main purpose seems to be publishing classic texts and poetry on the web, and it includes some very handy tools.
Getting indentation right is a problem with poetry on the web. For example, consider these lines from &amp;ldquo;The Code—Heroics&amp;rdquo; by Robert Frost.
Here is the Markdown source:
What was there wrong? Something you said just now.</description>

      <description>A poem by James Weldon Johnson (June 17, 1871 – June 26, 1938), American author, educator, lawyer, diplomat, and civil rights activist.
Nine people were shot in a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina, this week, and the evidence points to it being a racist hate-crime. So, 144 years and 1 day after his birth, we are reminded that some things, unfortunately have not changed.
 To America
How would you have us, as we are?</description>

      <title>Visit to a National Cemetery</title>

      <description>A poem for Memorial Day, 2015, written after conducting a funeral at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery, April 23, 2015.
The boy stared, amazed
at the ranks and files
of perfect straight lines.
Each member stood
at attention, a silent and still
granite memorial to one
who was a child once
before youth was taken,
leaving only scars
if anything at all.</description>

      <description>Some people tell me
that I look through
rose colored glasses,
because life can&amp;rsquo;t
be that good.
All I know is that
if my glass is only
half full it&amp;rsquo;s
because I have
drunk deeply
from the
joy,
wonder,
and
love
that is you.</description>

      <title>For Sheri</title>
      <link>http://randyridenour.net/2015/01/13/for-sheri/</link>

      <description>For Sheri on her birthday:
&amp;ldquo;Did you get
a good-morning
kiss?&amp;rdquo;
I ask.
&amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t think so.&amp;rdquo;
You reply,
even though I
know that&amp;rsquo;s not true.
Some couples won&amp;rsquo;t
speak for years
because of some
small lie.
So, how do
I feel?
Like a kid
who just heard
&amp;ldquo;No school - it&amp;rsquo;s
a snow day today.&amp;rdquo;
Like a person
who reached into
his jacket pocket
on the first day</description>

      <description>Heartbreak and hope
Must travel the same road,
Walking hand in hand,
Searching for the promised land.</description>

      <description>A hundred mile journey
from Nazareth to Bethlehem,
taken at the whim
of the emperor.
And two people,
who never counted to Caesar,
walked for days
to be counted by Caesar.
But Caesar rested easily in his palace,
not feeling the earth tremble
as the weight of the universe
was laid in a manger.</description>
