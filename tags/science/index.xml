      <description>John Gruber recently posted this interesting quote from Penn Jillette, of Penn and Teller fame:
 There is no god and thatâ€™s the simple truth. If every trace of any single religion died out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created exactly that way again. There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense. If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.</description>
