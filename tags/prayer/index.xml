      <description>God of Love,
When I see a stranger,
do you see a beloved child?
When I see an enemy,
do you see a friend?
May I see what is,
and not what I fear might be.
Even more,
may I see what could be,
if I were to give even a fraction
of the grace that I have received.
Amen</description>

      <description>A prayer for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s sermon at Spring Creek Baptist Church:
God of life,
Sometimes our prayers are as parched as the desert
and our hearts as dry as the dunes of sand.
We take offense at things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter,
but ignore the ones that do.
When others are hungry,
we are full.
When others are hurting,
we are numb.
When others are cold,
we rest comfortably
beneath warm blankets of apathy.</description>

      <description>It is finals week here at Oklahoma Baptist University. Here is a prayer for students:
Dear students,
May God calm your anxieties,
refresh your minds,
and honor the faithfulness
you have shown this semester.
Remember that God has gifted you
more than you can imagine,
and you are capable of more
than you&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed.
May the great wisdom of the Father,
the incomparable love of the Son,
and the mighty power of the Spirit</description>

      <description>(Photograph: Weeping Mary by Martin Gommel)1 
&amp;ldquo;Who is it you are looking for?&amp;rdquo;
is a question for me,
not just for Mary.
Mary looked at Jesus, and saw the gardener.
I look at my
neighbor, and see a stranger;
a stranger, an see an antagonist;
an antagonist, and see an enemy.
Help me, Lord, to see you,
wherever, and whoever, you are.
Amen

      <description>Loving God,
Despair or hope?
That was the choice
on that day when
all seemed lost.
Though it may
seem foolish,
we choose hope,
and wait to see
what tomorrow brings.

      <description>(Mosaic: Carrying the Cross of Christ by Gabriel Loire)1
It is a sign
that we cannot
really understand
what it means
for God to die,
that we remember
this day when
truth and beauty
hung upon a cross
and we call it good.
What our minds cannot comprehend,
our words cannot express.
So, we can do nothing
but stand in silence
before the glory
and the horror
of the cross.</description>

      <description>Holy God,
Examine my thoughts
on this Palm Sunday.
Does my Jesus&amp;hellip;
Want the very same things I want?
Love only the same people I love?
Hate all of the same people I hate?
Have an agenda that fits too easily into my own agenda?
Never say anything that makes me uncomfortable?
If so, then what is the object of my worship?
Is it a god of my own creation,</description>

      <description>With a kiss,
Judas gave his Lord
one last chance to be
the Messiah of Judas&amp;rsquo; dreams.
Am I no better than Judas,
when I twist the words of the Lord
and manipulate them for my own purposes?
Willing to betray the Lord,
and for what?
Not even thirty pieces of silver.
Lord, have mercy.

      <description>(Painting: Lamb by Francisco Zurbarán)1
The sounds of Passover
fill the streets with
desperate bleating
as all the animals
must be dragged
to play their
sacrificial roles.
All, that is, save one
who goes quietly
with determination,
strength, and purpose.
Lamb of God
have mercy on me.
Amen

      <description>Does my God
love only what I love,
and hate only what I hate?
If so, then who is my God?
Does my God
demand nothing of me
that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give?
If not, then what value is this grace?
Lead me away from the
altar of my convenience,
and teach me once again
what it means to love you.

      <description>Holy God,
Shall this year be like the past,
giving up that which brings joy,
so that my self-imposed poverty may be
a sign of spiritual superiority?
Instead, Lord,
by your grace,
may I give up
bitterness, arrogance,
animosity, and the
unwarranted certainty
that keeps me from
loving my neighbor.
Cover me with your ashes,
and raise me again
to walk anew
in your kingdom.

      <description>Thinking a lot about the power of language this week. Here&amp;rsquo;s my prayer for the week:
In arrogant blindness,
I fail to see that
what does not offend me
may still be offensive
to those around me.
Our words are keys,
with the power to
both lock and unlock.
They can open doors
to future conversations
or close them forever.
They can be vehicles of grace
or weapons of hate and destruction.</description>

      <description>Am I so wise
that I have nothing
left to learn,
or just afraid of
what I might hear?
Though others cannot,
the voice of God still speaks,
warning that justice comes,
both for me
and for those
I have silenced.
Amen</description>

      <description>Lord, hear my prayer.
For saying that something needs to be done
while refusing to do anything myself,
Lord, have mercy.
For believing that cries of outrage
were the same as acts of love,
Lord, have mercy.
For letting my own ego keep me from
reaching out to those with whom I disagree.
Lord, have mercy.
For pretending that loving humanity
was the same as loving my neighbor,
Lord, have mercy.</description>

      <description>We thank God
that we are not
like the ones
who fight
with violence
and bloodshed.
Instead, we fight
with words and images,
tweets and memes,
dollars and budgets.
The weapons are different,
but the pain is just as real.
Lord,
If we are to fight,
may we fight for something
worth fighting for,
Not our ideologies,
nor our egos,
But for what is right,
and for those who have no voice.</description>

      <description>Gracious God,
We live in a time of change,
sometimes inspiring and exciting,
sometimes distressing and frightening,
but always challenging.
Yet even in the midst of upheaval,
we can be sure of this:
The Father still loves us,
the Son still calls us,
The Spirit still leads us,
and we must still follow –
Together,
one body,
one faith.

      <title>The Sin of Ambivalence</title>

      <guid>http://randyridenour.net/2017/01/12/the-sin-of-ambivalence/</guid>
      <description>Holy God,
The greatest tragedy
is not to hate God,
for the one who hates
has God ever present
before his mind.
It is ambivalence,
thoughtless and uncaring,
a life that is at once
both full and empty,
full of trivialities,
yet empty of meaning
Heal my lukewarm heart, Lord,
and restore me to my first love.
Amen</description>

Self-righteous purity
with true holiness,
The voice of my own desires
with the voice of the Lord,
Or my own country
with the Kingdom of God.

      <description>In light of the recent political discussion concerning building walls, here is a devotional that I wrote in 2009 when the church assisted on a Habitat for Humanity project.
I&amp;rsquo;m usually in favor of building walls, but not when it just becomes another way to burn bridges.
Prayer Almighty God,
I give thanks for those who are here today to help build this house, for those who have already worked to bring us to this point, and for those who will be here in the future.</description>

Am I Joseph, listening to any way that God might speak?
Am I Mary, saying yes when others would jeer?
In the moments of stillness,
when all pretensions are dropped,</description>

      <description>Father of Light,
The creator of the universe
came to us as a helpless child,
reminding us that there is no
reconciliation without risk
or love without a chance of loss.
But we sacrificed peace
on the altar of security,
preferring to remain in darkness
than to venture out into the light,
desiring our kingdom more than yours.
Give us the courage
to drop our guard,

      <description>The Gospel text for the third Sunday of Advent in year A is Matthew 11:2-11, which, on the surface, seems like an odd choice for the Christmas season, especially for a day known as the &amp;ldquo;Sunday of joy.&amp;rdquo; It opens with what is apparently some doubt on the part of John the Baptist: &amp;ldquo;When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, &amp;lsquo;Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?</description>

      <description>Love left its throne,
to join us in our
weakness and frailty,
divine majesty
in a helpless babe,
To walk,
and laugh,
and cry
with us,
To show us what love
was willing to risk
for our sake.
And no matter
how much we tried,
even we could not
destroy its power.
Today, may love again
walk with my feet and
speak through my mouth.

      <description>This prayer is from 2014, but somehow seems fitting again this year:
Gracious God,
In the events of this year,
we see how fragile our lives truly are.
Daily, we are faced with a choice
to be people who live in cynicism and despair,
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.
On this day, we choose gratitude over despair,
and lift our hearts in thanksgiving to you,
the one who is the source of all good things.</description>

that they should seize
what is offered as a free gift?
What are these hands
that they should grasp
what should be shared?
What are these hands

at the thought that you
would ever bless anyone else?
What are these hands?
Just the hands of one
who would once again
crucify the Christ.

      <description>There are circumstances during which my failure becomes clearly evident, and the events of the past few days have given me needed opportunity to reflect on that failure.
God&amp;rsquo;s commandment is to love — a commandment given not to an abstract entity such as government or the church, but a commandment given to me.
Even more, God commanded me to love my neighbor — not the world or humanity, but my neighbor, the one who weeps in fear and pain, the one who offends me, the one with whom I disagree, and the one of whom I take no notice.</description>

      <description>Prayer for All Saints Day
Lord,
We search for heroes
among the rich, powerful,
strong and proud —
those who look more
like the crucifiers
than the crucified.
But on this day,
we give thanks
for those for whom
loving is more important
than being loved,
and faithfulness more
dear than fame.
Not our idols,
instead, your saints.
Amen</description>

      <description>A prayer for the days preceding the election:
God of comfort,
No matter the result,
Half of us will find
That the thing we fear
Will have come true.
Calm our fears,
And restore our faith.
Cleanse our despair,
And give us hope.
Banish our anger,
And renew our love.
Remind us once again
That the Spirit who unites us
Is greater than anything
That could ever divide us.
Amen</description>

      <description>God of Grace,
When Jesus was offered
the choice to be used
or to be silent,
He chose silence.
May I guard against
the temptation to craft
an image of Jesus to use
for my own political
and personal use.
Thy will, not my own, Lord.

If such a slender trunk
can weather the Oklahoma wind,
then surely we too can weather

into your sustaining love,
our branches reach out
to shelter those in need,
then reach up to the heavens
to bid your Kingdom come,
and your will be done.</description>

      <description>Creator God,
I gaze out from my fortress,
and see a dangerous, hostile place,
with dangers on all sides,
forcing me to defend my territory
against my many enemies.
Sometimes, I see a cold, unfeeling place,
that demands that I care only for myself,
since no one else will care for me.
Tell me what I would see, Lord,
if only I could replace these
grimy panes of doubt and fear,</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the USO at the Portland airport with some time to write the prayer for the week. The week of 9&amp;frasl;11 is always a time of reflection for me. In past years, I&amp;rsquo;ve generally thought about the cost to military families, compared to a country that mostly feels inconvenienced at the airport. This year, I thought instead about the wonderful friends I made during two deployments. Although I do wish that the conflict had never happened, those friends are gifts from God that I will always cherish.</description>

      <description>Thank you for the gift of friends,
those who are near,
and those who are far;
those still with us,
and those who await us
in the life to come.
Kind words remind us
that there is no distance,
neither time, nor space,
neither this life, nor the next,
that cannot be crossed.
For nothing can separate us
from the love of God,
and by that same love,
we are connected to each other.</description>

In these weeks of violence and tragedy,
we have mourned with those who grieve,
cried with those who weep,
sat in silence with those in pain,
and protested with those who suffer injustice.
But what should never happen even once
seems to happen over and over again,
until we are left with nothing
but bloodshot eyes and numb hearts.
Banish our fears, restore our hope,

      <description>Lord Jesus,
On this day that we mourn
the loss of so many whom you love,
it is tempting to pray
that you would return
and take us from this world.
Tempting, because it shifts
the burden to you,
leaving nothing for us
but escape, evasion, and excuse.
Yet you are not the God who excuses,
but the God who redeems;
not the God of escape,
but the God of the cross.</description>

      <description>Father,
Examine my heart,
show me my deepest desire.
Is it to be great,
safe,
secure,
invincible,
and strong?
Or is it to follow Jesus?
To build my protective fortress,
or to risk loving my neighbor?
To demand my rights,
or to take up the cross?
Not my will, but yours be done.
Amen</description>

      <description>Prince of Peace,
The palm branches
waving in Jerusalem
symbolized the dreams
of the people,
dreams of defeated enemies,
and a peace gained by
the overwhelming force of
divine power and might.
Instead of palms,
we wave flags,
grander symbols
of the same dreams.
Give us a new vision
of a world where
there are no enemies
to vanquish and
no wars to fight.
Not because we have won,
but because we have</description>

      <description>Blessed Lord,
You warned us of a broad path
that leads to destruction,
a path that so many seem to be walking.
It is an easy path
that calls us to
give in to our temptations
to hate, despise, and fear,
to become something less
than what you have created us to be.
You have called us to a higher path,
to renounce fear,
and proclaim faith,
to cast off hatred,</description>

      <description>The text for Mitch Randall&amp;rsquo;s sermon was the story of Simon the magician in Acts 8. As I though about the passage, I was struck by Simon&amp;rsquo;s willingness to pay for the power to confer the Holy Spirit on others, that is, his desire to exchange financial power for religious power. That, in turn, prompted me to think about the current role of religion in politics.
This week&amp;rsquo;s prayer:
You know my heart, O Lord.</description>

      <description>God of life,
Sometimes our prayers are as parched as the desert
and our hearts as dry as the dunes of sand.
We take offense at things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter,
but ignore the ones that do.
When others are hungry,
we are full.
When others are hurting,
we are numb.
When others are cold,
we rest comfortably
beneath warm blankets of apathy.
But even in our self-righteousness,
we still feel something,</description>

      <description>Father,
There are days
when it seems
like I&amp;rsquo;m creating
a minefield with
carefully placed
hazards of
discord,
ugliness,
and lies.
Help me instead
to plant seeds of
truth,
beauty,
and peace;
building a place
where others can
run without care —
Barefoot,
with joy,
in the fields

Father,
The dying tree,
desperate to stay alive,
tries to maintain
the illusion of being
healthy and full,
but it cannot
hide the truth,
for it saps life from
everything around it.
Forgive me,
for I take much
more than I give,
and like the tree,
never truly live.

once again taste
the goodness of
your grace, and

      <description>Holy God,
You call us into the night,
into the darkness,
to a place without distraction
where we can see only ourselves,
not as we wish we were,
but as we truly are.
We come hesitantly,
for we are afraid
to acknowledge
what we have become.
We come trembling,
knowing that hearts
that are hard
must somehow be broken.
We come with hope,
knowing that what
is broken can
again be made whole</description>

      <description>God of compassion,
Peter and John met a man
asking for alms
at the Beautiful Gate
of the temple.
We are not like Peter and John,
when they met the man
at the Beautiful Gate,
for we do have
silver and gold
to give.
But before we give,
we pray that you
would examine our hearts.
Do we give to maintain
the myth of our own superiority?
Do we give as a a means of exercising power?</description>

Lord,
If I really need it,

If I really don&amp;rsquo;t need it,
help me to resist the temptation to take it.
And if I need it and forget it,
may it be something I would have lost over there anyway.</description>

Joy, though, speaks with

laid in a manger to sleep.

There was a time when
we built idols of stone
that separated us from you.
Now, we are tempted
to build new idols,
walls that separate us

Forgive us, Lord,
for loving our own safety
more than we love the gospel,
and for sacrificing
the dream of true peace
on the altar of a
false sense of security.

better than I have been,

Thirty thousand lives

some by accident,
still others by strangers.
All were lost in
brutal acts of violence,
sacrificed on the altar

who speak no unkind words,
who never hurt one another,

      <description>Gracious God, Giver of life,
Long ago,
a tree was planted by your grace
and watered by your providential care.
It was robbed of
life and beauty,
and used to fashion a cross
to bear body of the Christ,
broken for our redemption.
And so, Lord, like that tree,
we have been planted,
watered, and have grown,
yet the time has come for us
to offer our lives to you,</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Where are you?&amp;rdquo;
The sound of heartbreak
rang through the garden
as the Lord went out
in the cool of the evening
to meet his children,
who hid in the place
that he gave them,
a place made for
fellowship with God.
God still calls,
and we still hide,
in places built for
communion with him,
masking our shame and fear
by doing the good while
failing to hear his call</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t find the original source of this blessing, but it&amp;rsquo;s attributed to the Franciscans. It&amp;rsquo;s both powerful and provocative to think of discomfort, anger, tears, and foolishness as blessings.
 May God bless you with discomfort,
At easy answers, half-truths,
And superficial relationships
So that you may live
Deep within your heart.
May God bless you with anger
At injustice, oppression,
And exploitation of people,
So that you may work for</description>

Lord of life,

Lord, teach me to hold my tongue.
Our minds are filled
with thoughts of
our next response,
devastatingly witty,
sarcastic, and biting.
Lord, teach me instead to listen.
Our eyes search
for the one
in the group
whom we need to know;
the one that will
help us succeed,
get ahead, and prosper
in the eyes of the world.</description>

      <description>Loving Creator,
Each of us is a
tapestry of threads
furnished by others
who were models,
teachers, and guides.
And as our paths diverge,
we take joy in this:
those who came before
are woven into the very
fabric of our lives,
each single thread
a gift of your divine grace.

      <description>God of peace and rest,
The parched landscape of the desert
yearns for the spring rains

to an otherwise barren land.
My soul yearns for Sabbath,
a rest that refreshes
and renews my barren soul,
that lays aside useless cares
and finds new hope in you.

      <description>Lord Jesus,
My mind is filled with
beautiful memories
and wonderful dreams,
thoughts of things that were
and others that may someday be.
But one eye to the past,
and the other to the future,
leaves me blind to this moment;
thanking you for life,
while refusing to live it.
May I never forget
that the Lord of the past and future
is also Lord in the meantime.

      <description>Today is the feast day of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Here is one of his prayers:
Suscipe (Receive)
Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty,
my memory, my understanding
and my entire will,
All I have and call my own.
You have given all to me.
To you, Lord, I return it.
Everything is yours; do with it what you will.
Give me only your love and your grace.
That is enough for me.</description>

      <description>God of Grace,
Everywhere we turn
we are flooded with
sights and sounds
of evil,
tragedy,
injustice,
and the suffering
of the innocent.
And even we,
watching from places
of comfort and security
can be overwhelmed
by the darkness,
and begin to lose hope.
Then, we see a baby smile,
and the light breaks in,
reminding us that hope prevails
and that beauty surrounds us,
a gracious reminder of
the world that was,</description>

there is no guarantee of the future,
not even of the next moment on this earth;
for that moment is hidden from me until it comes,
and only you know what this day will bring.
Help me to see this day for what it is,
a gift, although expected,
one that was surely not owed,
an act of immeasurable grace.
So, thank you for this day</description>

      <description>As I listened to Mitch Randall&amp;rsquo;s sermon last Sunday at NorthHaven Church in Norman, Oklahoma, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but reflect on Paul&amp;rsquo;s words in Philippians 2. I hope the prayer for the week reflects that thought.
Father,
Protect us from the arrogance
of unwarranted certainty,
as it keeps us from hearing
the voice of our neighbor.
Cleanse us from the vanity
of inflated self-importance,
as it moves us to see only ourselves.</description>

      <description>God of love and grace,
Before there was anything else,
there was love,
perfect and pure.
It was a love so full
that it manifested itself
in the creation of the infinite universe
in all of its beauty and diversity.
We rejoice today with those
who shed tears of joy
when, against all odds,
love won.
Our joy, though, is not yet complete,
as we grieve today with those
who shed tears of sorrow</description>

      <description>A reflection on the lives lost this week in Charleston, and the responsibility that we bear, either explicitly or implicitly:
God of justice,
We are told that heaven rejoices
over what has been found,
does heaven also weep for
what has been lost?
For the one whose heart
was lost in hatred,
and whose mind was
filled with empty lies?
For the nine lives that

There are days when I wish
that you had given us
a blueprint for life,
with every step
mapped out in detail,
and every decision
already made.
Instead, you gave us
each a life for a canvas,
and gifts and talents
for a palette and brushes,
the Spirit for our guide,
and the Son for our model,
then you sent us out
into the world to paint.</description>

the eternal fellowship
that is the

three persons,

      <description>God of Grace and Wholeness,
All around us, we see pain and heartache,
the effects of fragmented and broken systems,
communities, and families.
When the pain of others becomes
too much for us to bear,
we respond by building up walls
that separate us from the world.
So here we stay,
safe and secure
behind our walls of division,
seeing only ourselves,
our own problems,
and our own hopes.
We boast of our love for humanity,</description>

      <description>Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day can be an awkward time in the life of the church. There is a great deal of internal pressure to commemorate the day, but we should acknowledge that there are many who are understandably uncomfortable on this day. There are those who may have painful memories of abuse at the hand of their biological mothers, others who may have never known their mothers, and many others who have never had, nor will ever have, children of their own.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s prayer is simple, but informed by events of the week that profoundly impacted me. First, NorthHaven Church​ was in the area that sustained some wind damage in Wednesday night&amp;rsquo;s storm. The next day, Imam Imad Enchassi​ of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City graciously asked if we needed any help. To all our Muslim friends, As-Salaam-Alaikum.
Second, I see in my students a level of spiritual depth that I certainly did not have in my 20&amp;rsquo;s and may not yet have in my 50&amp;rsquo;s — one that moves beyond the superficial trivialities that pass for spirituality in much of American religion, but instead shows a deep understanding of the message of Jesus.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Yes, justice,&amp;rdquo;
comes the reply,

we must have peace.
Peace today,
maybe justice tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;
But a peace without justice,
is not the Shalom of God.
It is a peace that serves
the status quo,
the interests of the powerful,

There are times when
we just have no words,
times of great beauty,
or times of great suffering.
But our silence
makes us uncomfortable,
and we feel that
we must say something,
so we fill the silence
with meaningless noise
and empty chatter.
So, when we feel the urge
to trivialize the sublime
with our vain babbling,
give us the strength
to cover our mouths

Then, on Tuesday, I learned of two more tragedies involving families in the Army units that I serve. Coincidentally, all of this happens as one of my classes is studying one of the central works on the problem of suffering, the chapter titled in &amp;ldquo;Rebellion&amp;rdquo; in Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece, The Brothers Karamazov.</description>

hang from sparkling
gold chains,
signs of
wealth, affluence,

compared to
a large wooden cross
covered in blood,
an instrument of torture,
a symbol designed

On this day, Lord,

of the horror of the cross,
for without it
there is no beauty
of the cross.

      <description>Lord,
How would you have us known to the world?
By whom we exclude?
By what we hate?
By whom we refuse to serve?
By our purity?
Instead, we are to be known
by our love&amp;hellip;
Love,
in all its
messy,
entangled,
accepting,
and sometimes awkward
beauty.
Amen</description>

      <description>With praise and palm branches,
the people celebrated
their new freedom
from their Greek overlords.
And in a new century,
and under a new empire,
the people once again
wave the palm branches
and cheer for a new hero.
Jesus rode into Jerusalem
and the people cheered,
but Jesus wept,
for they could not see
that the Jesus for whom we cheer
is not the same Jesus
that we behold upon the cross</description>

      <description>A woman asked Jesus
to heal her daughter,
and Jesus said nothing.
Pilate asked Jesus
to defend himself,
and Jesus said nothing.
Yet the girl was healed,
and Jesus went to the cross.
Forgive me, Lord,
for the sin of
saying everything but
doing nothing.

      <description>The best sermons open our eyes to present realities, give us hope for a future in the Kingdom, and challenge us to move forward into that future. Yesterday’s sermon by Mitch Randall​ at NorthHaven Church​ was certainly one of those. Here is the prayer for the week:

      <description>A prayer for reconciliation.
God of love,
We open our arms
to hug and to hold,
welcome and invite.
With outstretched hands,
we lower our defenses
and accept the vulnerability
that comes with love.
Did the soldiers know
what they were doing
as they stretched the arms
of Jesus onto the cross?
Humiliated and scorned,
the Eternal King
chose vulnerability, love,
and reconciliation
instead of rejection.
Give us the courage</description>

sleeping on a bench
in the cold,
And I say,
&amp;ldquo;Thank you, Lord,

I see a woman
alone, in tears,
mourning,
And I say,
&amp;ldquo;Thank you, Lord,
for I am not like her.&amp;rdquo;
I see a man
upon a cross,
humiliated, scorned,
despised,
And suddenly my
foolish pride is clear
even to me,
And I cry,

for I am not like you.</description>

      <description>Lord Jesus,
As I find myself
grasping for more,
even though I
surely have enough,
I hear the voice
of the Spirit whisper,
&amp;ldquo;Is this how you
follow the one
who had no place
to lay his head,
whose only robe
was taken from him
and gambled away?&amp;rdquo;
May I never confuse
the abundant life
with an empty
life of abundance.

yet speak to others with words that hurt and destroy.
Lord, have mercy,
for I have been given more than I could ever use,
yet refuse to see the needs of those around me.
Lord, have mercy,
for you have placed me in positions of power and influence,
yet I use those positions for my own gain, and not in service to your children.</description>

      <description>Father,
In the blindness of our arrogance,
we think that we are free,
yet, so often, we are in chains,
slaves to the satisfaction of our own desires,
and to the pursuit of our own selfish ends.
Our prayer today is that
we may be transformed,
freed, so that we may
live as Christ lived,
and love as he loved,
every moment of our lives
an act of restoration and redemption,</description>

      <description>Casie Trotter sent me a link to a wonderful passage from Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s 1882 book, The Gay Science. This is aphorism 276, his resolution for that year:
 I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them — thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful&amp;hellip; I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accusel I do not even want to accuse the accusers&amp;hellip; And all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!</description>

      <description>Jesus,
You found a man living in a cemetery,
bound by chains that he did not forge,
forced on him by people who were afraid.
I, too, am bound in chains,
some forged by ignorance,
every link a failure to recognize
your image in another human.
Others forged by arrogance,
of thinking that there are those
not fit for your kingdom,
or for your service.
Still others forged by fear,</description>

      <description>This was a prayer I delivered at NorthHaven Church in Norman for the Christmas Day service on December 25, 2011.
Gracious Father,
We gather here in this place to celebrate the day the world changed.
On that day, one who was pure spirit became incarnate;
The eternal Word became clothed in a frail human body;
That which no human had ever touched was laid by a gentle mother&amp;rsquo;s hand into a simple manger;</description>

      <description>Mitch Randall&amp;rsquo;s sermon this Sunday was on loving one&amp;rsquo;s enemies, a notion that I believe is the radically distinctive concept in the ethics of Jesus. This week&amp;rsquo;s prayer:
In this deeply divided world,
the best we hope for is
tolerance,
absence of conflict,
live and let live.
The path that we have taken
is not the way of Jesus,
who said,
&amp;ldquo;Love your enemies and
pray for those who persecute you.</description>

      <description>Lord Jesus,
What kind of king are you?
The kingdoms of this earth
Pride themselves on their power,
Their majesty,
Their influence,
And their wealth.
Yet you say that your kingdom is like
A small seed,
Yeast,
And a net.
May your kingdom fill our lives
As the yeast permeates the dough.
As we grow from this small seed
May we provide shelter and shade to those in need,
Yet remaining rooted in you,</description>

      <description>What is it like
to burn,
but never burn up;
to endure the pain
of the flame,
but never know
the relief of destruction?
With no hope for the future,
and no memory of their past,
your people endured
the burden of slavery;
people who burn,
but never burn up.
Then Moses heard a voice,
saying,
&amp;ldquo;I see their misery;
I hear their cries;
indeed, I know their sufferings.

shed all the privileges of God,
also shed his outer robe.
Wrapping himself in a simple towel,
he lovingly washed the disciples&amp;rsquo; feet
with his calloused hands.
Teach us, Lord, to shed
our own trappings of power and prestige,
as we reach out to those rejected by the world;
and may we always have the grace to accept
the things that you have had the grace to offer.</description>

      <description>Even though I fear the answer,
I must still ask the question
that was posed
by the one who betrayed the Lord.
&amp;ldquo;Am I the one?&amp;rdquo;
Am I the one who
sat in the comfort
of the palace of the High Priest
to plot your death
because you were a threat
to my religious authority?
Am I the one who
from the confines of another palace
washed my hands of you,</description>

Sell all you have,
Give to the poor,
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry,
Forgive,
Be not afraid.&amp;rdquo;
We reply,
&amp;ldquo;Surely, he didn&amp;rsquo;t mean what he said.
We can&amp;rsquo;t,
It&amp;rsquo;s not natural,
It&amp;rsquo;s impossible.&amp;rdquo;
Then Easter comes,
And we are left speechless.
May your beauty draw us,
Your power strengthen us,
And your love compel us
To live fully as citizens of your kingdom.</description>

Lord Jesus,
Children take what is given them
With joy and gratitude,
Without pretense,
Never second-guessing
The motives of the giver.
You told us that we must
Receive the Kingdom as a little child,
Yet our pride keeps us from accepting
That which you offer by the hands of your servants.

For those who have given much
And have gone on to their eternal rest,
We give thanks.
For those who labor joyfully
So that others may see Jesus,

For both laughter and tears,
When shared with those who love deeply,
We give thanks.
And for a church where Christ is proclaimed
Yet an Imam feels welcome,
We give thanks.

With names like
Alexander,
Hannibal,
Caesar,
Napoleon;
Men who took up arms,
And with violence,
Bent the world to their will.
But history whispers
Of others,
The faceless ones,
Who were deemed
To insignificant to name.

Who, with her daughter,
Gave her son to the Nile,
Yet found a way to get him back,
And by saving her son,</description>

Of one who was
Ugly,
Despised,
Rejected,
One who knew pain,

That we keep hidden.

We live in a word of concrete barricades, wooden fences, and stone walls that we have built to protect, separate, control, and hide; some hastily thrown up in hours, others carefully built in weeks or months.
Other walls, though, are constructed over a lifetime, and are just as real and just as effective—downcast eyes, hostile stares, and stony silence—walls constructed to prevent the pain of rejection, or to keep others out of our comfortable lives.</description>

      <description>Holy God,
For those times
when we hear
the ridicule,
the jeers,
the insults,
and see the looks
of pain and loneliness,
yet stand in uncomfortable silence,
and do nothing,
Lord have mercy.
And for those times
when we strike back
at those who hurt us,
and start another
cycle of violence
that has no end in sight,
Christ have mercy.
The powerful rested
easy on their thrones,
when the things of God</description>

      <description>Another thought-provoking sermon at NorthHaven this week - this time, from Bryan Partridge.
Here is the prayer for the week:
A good actor devotes herself to her role,
and carefully learns her lines;
while constantly studying the finest
performances of the past.
At first, after many missed cues
and fumbled lines,
she fears she may never get it right.
But with wise direction,
and hours of rehearsing,
every word,
and every gesture,</description>

      <description>We say that God helps those who help themselves,
that cleanliness is next to godliness,
that money is the root of all evil,
that God will not give us more than we can handle,
and that he works in mysterious ways.
Father,
Open our eyes to the Scripture you have given us,
and free us from the temptation
to turn it into the one that we want.
Amen</description>

      <description>When we discuss the concept of rights in political philosophy, I confess that I feel conflicted. On one hand, the recognition of, and commitment to, the rights of others is essential to treating them with the dignity that is due to one created in the image of God. On the other hand, the constant practice of demanding my own rights does not seem consistent with the claim to follow the one that Paul described in Philippians 2:</description>

I see images of the hungry and ill,

My prayers are just fervent enough,

my charity just generous enough,
my heart just cold enough.
Father,
forgive me,
and cleanse me of the sin
of being just enough.

      <description>Loving God,
Apathy is a vice
easily disguised
behind veils
of busy lives,
carefully built
to avoid the
demands of love.
Forgive me,
not just because
I pretend to care,
but that I
deceive myself -
believing in
the pretending
more than
in the caring.

      <description>Sheri and I recently spent the weekend with some soldiers from my Afghanistan deployment and their families. I wrote this prayer after reflecting on the experience:
God of promise and hope,
We give thanks today for shared memories.
The stories bring healing
as they are told and retold,
for they remind us
that joy is found in surprising places.
Cherish our remembering,
and strengthen our minds

      <description>I love it when a minister points out something that I had never noticed in the text. Mitch Randall certainly did that this past Sunday. So, this prayer recalls Daniel&amp;rsquo;s action to save his competitors in Babylon as recounted in Daniel 2.
If there is to be a winner, there must be a loser. or so it goes in the games we play, in games of sport, and in games of life.</description>

      <description>In response to a sermon on Daniel 3:
How shall we respond to the furnaces of life? We make empty promises, saying that God must deliver, Mere feeble attempts to bind God&amp;rsquo;s will With pledges that we cannot guarantee.
Instead, we are called to be strong and courageous, And if rescue is promised, Then of what value is courage?
Lord, Give us the strength to face the flames Like the three in Babylon, Who dared not promise to show what God would do for them, But promised instead to show what they would do for God.</description>

I was still fuming and telling myself that I wish I could have told them what I really thought as they pulled into the parking space beside me. Fortunately, I had just heard Mitch Randall&amp;rsquo;s sermon on Daniel in the lions&amp;rsquo; den the day before.</description>

      <description>We missed worship at NorthHaven this past Sunday, although I hear that there was an exceptional sermon by Bryan Partridge. Instead, I was at the 2014 meeting of the Baptist Association of Philosophy Teachers. A common theme of the presentations that I heard was the virtue of humility, one that seems often missing from academic life. This week&amp;rsquo;s prayer:
Holy God,
Protect me from the temptation to mistake sarcasm for honesty, cynicism for realism, and cleverness for wisdom.</description>

We pray for the coming of your Kingdom

not reflections of the desires of our hearts.

Why do you continue to use me? What good am I to you?
I am a flawed, broken, undependable tool.
One that makes mistakes, and asks for second chances.
But I hear a gentle voice whispering a message of hope, that my heart longs to hear&amp;hellip;
That even a flawed and broken tool can make something beautiful when it&amp;rsquo;s used by the master.</description>

with just a little Jesus,

A faith that trusts,

A faith that dreams,

I&amp;rsquo;ll give you Sunday,

I&amp;rsquo;ll give you ten percent,
so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t
ask what I do with
the other ninety.
I&amp;rsquo;ll do whatever you ask,
just don&amp;rsquo;t make any
unreasonable demands.

still used to

one that even we ourselves
can eventually come to believe.

 At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. &amp;ldquo;I believed that you were a friend before the letter came,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;or at least I wished to.</description>

In the events of this year,
we see how fragile our lives truly are.
Daily, we are faced with a choice
to be people who live in cynicism and despair,
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.
On this day, we choose gratitude over despair,
and lift our hearts in thanksgiving to you,
the one who is the source of all good things.
Thank you

Attention is not love, because attention can easily be followed by an act of hate. Attention is a necessary condition of love; it is impossible to love something unless on pays attention to the object of love.</description>

      <description>Jesus saw the lame man at the pool,
and asked, &amp;ldquo;Do you want to be made well?&amp;rdquo;
Instead of an answer,
the man gave an explanation.
But explanations become rationalizations,
and rationalizations become excuses,
and &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; just means &amp;ldquo;No, thank you.&amp;rdquo;
Lord,
Forgive us for preferring
the familiarity of the present pain
to the joy of new life that you offer.

do I use them,
or do they use me?
